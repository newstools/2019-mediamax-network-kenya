A Kenyan female police officer is among seven suspects who were arrested in the coastal city of Mombasa with cocaine and heroin in an ongoing war of drug trafficking in the country, the police said on Sunday. Hamdi Yusuf Maalim, who is attached to Likoni police station, was arrested with her companion in Diani, South coast on Friday. “We have a long list of suspects and we are sure we will get them if they don’t surrender. We hear others have escaped to Tanzania and other places but we are after you even if you are a public servant,” Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata told journalists in Mombasa. He said the two had already established a drug distribution route to Garissa, northern Kenya. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) officers from Nairobi raided their house and recovered three kilograms of cocaine worth 12 million shillings (about 112,000 U.S. dollars) and two kilograms of heroin worth about 60,000 dollars. Police said Maalim, who has been on police wanted list is leader of a cartel which has been operating in Likoni area for a long period of time. Alfan Rahma Ali, Maalim’s accomplice was arrested by police on Saturday. The two are members of the drug cartel headed by another suspect Swaleh Ahmed who has ongoing court case for trafficking 100 kilograms of cocaine. Police detained three vehicles they believe belong to the suspects. “Let us bring efforts together to clean up our city of drug barons. Many of youths are hooked to the drugs and we don’t want this to continue,” said Elungata. He said that other individuals under police watch include workers at the Moi International Airport and Kenya Port Authority. (Xinhua)
