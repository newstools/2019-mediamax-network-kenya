Nissan Kenya has donated desks and school stationery worth Sh300, 000 to Iganjo primary school in Gatanga Constituency. Nissan Kenya Managing Director Mr. Gerhard Benard, said the move was part of the auto maker’s CSR as the company aims to give back to the community it serves. “At Nissan Kenya we feel we have a responsibility to the greater market that we serve and we try to do that through identifying needs of the less privileged that we can assist with,” he said, adding that ‘Building a nation starts by empowering a younger generation to become more and do greater.” The items were received by the school’s head teacher, Mrs. Njoroge. The items donated will benefit a special unit class with 12 students who have mental challenges and would like to enroll more but this is hampered by inadequate furniture and facilities. The school is on a slope and it is very difficult for students to get around to their classes especially when it rains since it gets very slippery, the teachers have therefore implemented a new program in which students are kept in their classes for longer periods of the day. The donation will also go a long way in making the students a little more comfortable during learning and thus for the longer periods being seated during subject changes.
