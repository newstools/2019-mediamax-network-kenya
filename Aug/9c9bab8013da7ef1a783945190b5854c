NAIROBI, Gordon Kihalangwa, principal secretary for immigration and citizen services at Kenya’s Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, at a migration forum in Nairobi on July 18, 2019 said that there are approximately 3,500 Shonas living in Kenya.
“There is a current global effort to ensure that statelessness is addressed and Kenya being a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact for Migration is keen to ensure it solves the statelessness within its borders. Once the naturalization process starts it will take one year to conclude the exercise,” said Kihalangwa.
Kihalangwa said that the Shonas came to Kenya in 1960s to work as missionaries. They are stateless and have difficulty in accessing services such education, health and employment.
Kihalangwa said that a multiagency team has been put in place to spearhead the exercise of granting citizenship to the Shona people.
In 2017, Kenya began providing citizenship to the Makonde people who trace their roots to Mozambique.  (Xinhua)
