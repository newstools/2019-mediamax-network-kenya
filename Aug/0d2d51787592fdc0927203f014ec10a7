Kenya on Wednesday reopened the upmarket Dusit D2 hotel, six months after an attack by Somalia-based al-Shabab militants in mid-January that killed 21 people. The Thai hotel chain lost six staff members in the terror attack at a Nairobi business complex. Najib Balala, cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and wildlife, said the reopening of Dusit D2 hotel reaffirmed the resilience of Kenya’s business environment despite terror threats. “The government is committed to supporting growth of hospitality sector and will not be distracted by the evil forces of terrorism,” Balala said, adding that Kenya has intensified surveillance at hotels and lodges to prevent terrorist attacks. David Rudisha, Kenya’s 800m world record holder, led a commemorative race to honor victims of the Jan. 15 attack. Michael Metaxas, general manager of Dusit D2 Hotel Nairobi, said its reopening was a reprieve for tourists and business travelers yearning for accommodation in a secure and serene environment. “We had already received bookings prior to the reopening of the hotel and have reinforced safety measures for our clients and staff,” Metaxas said. He said the hotel chain embarked on training staff on customer care and personal security during its six-month closure. Five al-Shabab militants stormed into Dusit D2 hotel and adjacent office blocks where they killed 21 people but were later neutralized by elite commandos after a siege that lasted about 15 hours.
