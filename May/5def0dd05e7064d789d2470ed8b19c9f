Barcelona, Thursday @PeopleSports11 Lionel Messi insists Barcelona still have work to do at Anfield despite his heroics securing a 3-0 first-leg win in the Champions League semi-final. The diminutive Argentine genius hammered in a free-kick from 35 yards for the third after scoring a tap in following Luis Suarez’s first-half opener. It would take a miraculous comeback from Liverpool to advance to the final next Tuesday night but Messi doesn’t want to take his foot off the gas. “We were so close to the fourth goal at the end. The 3-0 is a very good result but it’s not definite because we are going to a great stadium where the crowd will really get behind their team,” he said after full time at the Nou Camp. Physical game At the start of the season Messi was vocal in his desire to win the Champions League again. Now his side are on the cusp of the final, but they were given a scare against the Reds, who pushed them hard despite the unflattering scoreline. Messi put the Catalan side 2-0 up with this tap in and they are heavy favourites to progress “At the start we got drawn into their sort of very physical game and we are not used to it and that’s why we found it difficult at times early on,” Messi continued. “It’s important that we did not concede. An away goal gives you so much.” On scoring his 600th goal for the club with the jaw-dropping set-piece, he remarked: “It was a spectacular free-kick. I’m was so happy to see it go in.”        -DAILYMAIL
