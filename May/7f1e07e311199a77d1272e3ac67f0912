Irene Githinji @gitshee Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi risks losing his seat after Amani National Congress vowed that it will  not turn back on its decision to kick him out of the position of secretary general. On Tuesday, the High Court overruled the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal decision to reinstate him as secretary general after he was removed by the party. The party said  Osotsi was to blame for ignoring several summons to explain his side of the story. Osotsi has said he will not appeal the High Court’s decision. He said that while he felt there were inadequacies in the ruling, he will respect and abide by the court’s decision and solve the matter through the party’s internal dispute mechanism, including mediation. On March 26, ANC wrote to Registrar of Political Parties asking it to remove Osotsi from its register. Osotsi’s replacement, Barrack Muluka, gave 42 reasons why Osotsi should be removed from the party’s register. “We are satisfied that the party has bent backwards to accommodate Osotsi and given him space for amicable internal address and resolution of issues leading to his expulsion from the party. Our patience, composure and respect for due process has been abused,” Muluka said in the letter. “It is our firm understanding of the law that the ORPP is obliged to remove from our register people who have ceased to be our members,” he added. In its ruling, the High Court directed that internal dispute mechanisms be exhausted. Justice Cecilia Githua overturned the tribunal’s decision saying it lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute because the MP had not exhausted ANC’s internal mechanisms.
