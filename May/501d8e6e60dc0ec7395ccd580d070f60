Malawi President Peter Mutharika has dissolved his cabinet ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next week. Campaigns for the elections, which analysts say will be closely contested, have intensified with candidates crisscrossing the country seeking votes. A statement from Malawi’s state house said the cabinet had been dissolved and the president would assume all ministerial duties. This is in line with the country’s constitution that requires the cabinet to be disbanded ahead of the polls. Incumbent President Peter Mutharika is facing competition from six other candidates including two of his own ministers. Vice President Saulos Chilima is vying on a United Transformation Movement ticket while immediate former health minister Atupele Muluzi is the flag bearer of the United Democratic Front party. Meanwhile the Malawi Electoral Commission says it has received all ballot materials for the vote. This will be the first time the country will be using electronic voting. Malawians will be electing a president, parliamentarians and local councilors in the elections. -BBC
