Leslie Sercombe powered her White Dragon to victory against stable mates in the 3,200m Kenya Gold Cup/George Drew Challenge Series on Sunday. The Ngong Racecourse event that collectively had five runners from the Patsy Sercombe stable saw the eventual winner cross the line by a commanding four-and-a-quarter length in a meet clocked at 3:39:4. Fellow big runner Tenby, handled by James Muhindi, finished second just a few metres ahead of Pharaohs Advocate, jockeyed steadily by Patrick Mungai. It was a race that was centred on endurance given the distance covered and for fillies like Navy Seal, it was a bit of a struggle given the pace involved towards the finish. It was the ninth win inside 13 starts for White Dragon and veteran jockey Sercombe believed the start was important in determining the direction of the race. “It was important to get going strong especially since the pack was tough. For us, it was straight out getting a good spot then setting pace which is what we executed well enough.” Meanwhile in another feature race, the 2,060m Ultra Sharp Trophy also scored points for a feisty race to keep the fans and punters on edge. Once again, jockey Leslie proved her mettle with a tidy run atop American bred fillie that was doing her 17th race across the season.  However, it was tight at the finish as the fillie and the next challenger Eternal were only separated by one-and-a-quarter length.
