Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga Sixteen senior officials at the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) have been reshuffled in another shakeup aimed at dismantling graft cartels. The changes announced by managing director Daniel Manduku (pictured), have affected several heads of departments. Among those transferred are three managers who have been grilled by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over the Sh40 billion Kipevu Oil Terminal scandal. The three include Head of Procurement and Supplies Anthony Nyamancha, Tender Opening and Evaluation Committee Secretary Aza Dzengo and William Tenay, a member of the due diligence team. Nyamancha who was confirmed to the position just recently, became the first casualty after he was moved to head the Laison Markets office in Kampala and his position taken by by Dzengo in acting capacity. Head of Security Mariam Khamis has been moved to the Inland Container Depot (ICD) Nairobi as the head of ICT. Manduku said the redeployment had been sanctioned by a regular board meeting held on Tuesday.
