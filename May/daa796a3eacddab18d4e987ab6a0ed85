Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Activist Boniface Mwangi was yesterday arrested at his Nairobi home by detectives attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over alleged links to a revolutionary group seeking a footing in the country. Police are accusing Mwangi of organising “revolution likely to cause civil unrest and also cause a breach of peace”. He was grilled for more than three hours before being released at 3pm after being detained at the Central Police Station, Nairobi. Abortive protest In 2014, Mwangi, Reverend Timothy Njoya and local artist Eric Wainaina organised an abortive anti-government demonstration dubbed “State of the Nation” that was violently blocked by heavily armed police at Uhuru Park, Nairobi allegedly funded by the United States-based Agency for International Development (USAID). The incident posed a major diplomatic strain between the two governments with Kenya threatening to expel the NGO from the country after intelligence uncovered underhand plans to sabotage the government by financing a series of anti-government demonstrations.
