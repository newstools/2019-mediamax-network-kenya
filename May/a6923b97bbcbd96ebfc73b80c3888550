The Kenya Plantations and Agricultural Workers Union wants a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) signed  between it and Kenya Tea Growers’ Association before Friday. The union’s assistant secretary general Meshack Khisa said workers in multi-national tea firms have not  received any salary increment for the past six years since CBA expired. Speaking in Kericho town, he said workers of the tea firms in Kericho and Bomet counties will embark on a hunger strike at KTGA offices in Kericho town if the new CBA will not have been signed before the week ends. Khisa, who is also the KPAWU lawyer, lamented that the association management has been delaying the issue and moving to courts to stop and frustrate efforts to have a new CBA in place. “We want to sign a new CBA with our employers before May 10 failure to which, our members will camp at the KTGA offices until we achieve our demands. We last signed the CBA with KTGA in 2012. We are demanding only 10 per cent salary increment,” he said. The unionist said the workers deserved the pay hike because of inflation and high cost of living. He also urged Bomet and Kericho county assemblies to enact legislation to outlaw tea plucking machines. He said KPAWU is opposed to mechanical tea harvesting because it poses danger to operators, who are not trained. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony said his administration will work closely with relevant National government agencies to support efforts aimed at enhancing working conditions in all sectors of the economy. “My administration will not tolerate cases of any kind of abuse and mistreatment of employees. Any employer trampling on workers rights and contravening the labour laws will face the music,” he said and urged employers to support breast feeding workers.
