Mercy Mwai @Wangumarci Members of the National Assembly have commenced investigations into the Sh2.8 billion fiber optic cable project that was meant to connect buildings that house both National and County government headquarters. The powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chaired by Opiyo Wandayi said it wants to interrogate the matter to establish whether there was value for money after it emerged that the deal was government-to-government contract between Kenya and China. The MPs also want to establish whether Kenyans benefited from the deal after it emerged that only menial jobs were given to Kenyans. At a meeting with ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng, the committee directed ICT ministry to furnish it with all contract documentsÂ  on the deal.
