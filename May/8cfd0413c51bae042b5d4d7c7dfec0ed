Battle for promotion to the Kenya Cup takes centre stage at Catholic University and United States International University-Africa (USIU-Africa) grounds tomorrow with four teams searching for the two available slots. Hosts Catholic Monks will take on Kisumu RFC while USIU-Africa Martials welcome Kakamega-based Western Bulls. Kiusmu and Bulls are seeking a return to the top flight, having been out in the cold for three and two years respectively but with the hosts enjoying home ground advantage, their work is cut out. However, Bulls coach Bram Shikanda is oozing confidence. “It is the most important match of the season and we are going to give it our all. We, however, expect a tough opponent given it is a knockout match,” said Shikanda. Bulls will hope try machine Derrick Ashiundu is well-oiled for the duel having been impressive all season. “The team is holding on well. Most of the injuries have healed after the break and they have gelled. Ashiundu is in fine form right now and I expect an outstanding performance from him,” added Shikanda. Shikanda’s USIU counterpart Dennis Mwanja is unfazed though. He said: “We are ready for them. The boys are in a good mood. Game day has its own intricacies so just taking care of what we can control. We are at home and the whole school will be behind us. I’m confident we will come out victorious.” USIU’s answer to Bulls’ Ashiundu is Eliud Mulla who is the league’s second best scorer with eight tries and also good on dead balls where he is the division’s top points getter. “Eliud is a good leader and an inspiration. He will be very influential in the match but he won’t do it alone, it is teamwork,” added Mwanja.
