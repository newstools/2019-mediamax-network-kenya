Another fan said: “It is very sad that people like Essa, Muna have dinosaurs for rally machines! As a result they will just be there to watch or to escort Leroy and Guy as they face the Kenyans! Those are the only two who have cars that can enable them enjoy putting up some fight against Kenyan crack rally drivers!” Another fan bantered: “If Barcelona can be given some good slaps in football what can stop our very own Subarus to whack those believed to be big guns in Twapia Ndola.
