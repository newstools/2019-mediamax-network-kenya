Dubai, Tuesday Investigators sought Tuesday to shed light on a series of mysterious attacks on ships off the coast of the UAE, as President Donald Trump warned Iran against doing anything to harm US interests. Washington and its Gulf allies stopped short of blaming Tehran for what the UAE and Saudi Arabia called the “sabotage” of four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, on Sunday. But Trump vowed that Tehran would “suffer greatly” were it to “do anything” to threaten US interests. “If they do anything, it would be a very bad mistake,” Trump warned at the White House. “If they do anything they will suffer greatly.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hit back, saying the Islamic republic was “too great to be intimidated by anyone”. “God willing we will pass this difficult period with glory and our heads held high, and defeat the enemy,” Rouhani said at a late night meeting with clerics. The attacks came after the United States deployed B-52 bombers and an assault ship to bolster an aircraft carrier in the region. The dispatch of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group, the amphibious assault vessel, a Patriot missile battery and the bombers has triggered fears of a possible military confrontation. “In an environment of rising regional tensions, limited Iranian operations against the UAE and Saudi Arabia might be designed to dissuade Abu Dhabi and Riyadh and signal that war with Iran will not be limited to Iranian soil,” said Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. A UAE government official said the Saudi oil tankers Al-Marzoqah and Amjad were attacked off the emirate of Fujairah along with the Norwegian tanker Andrea Victory and an Emirati ship, the A. Michel.  – AFP
