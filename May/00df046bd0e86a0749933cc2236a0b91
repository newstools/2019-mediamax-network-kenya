French firm Idemia Securities Limited, formerly OT Morpho, yesterday suffered a major setback after it lost a bid to temporarily suspend a 10-year ban recently imposed by the National Assembly. In his ruling, High Court judge John Mativo said no show of threat will be caused if a stay is granted and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has a duty to investigate the company.“I find and hold that circumstances of this case do not warrant a stay,” he said. Last week, Idemia sued the National Assembly after MPs recommended that the company be barred from conducting business over its alleged role in procurement malpractices at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) before the 2017 elections. MPs also recommended that the DCI and Director of Public Prosecutions investigate Idemia. The firm, through lawyer Wilfred Lusi, claims the National Assembly decision was unfair and unlawful because it  was not given a chance to defend itself. “Further, the sanctions imposed and/or recommended to be imposed against the applicant for the alleged lack of local registration when it performed its contract (are) not provided for in law,” he said. Idemia further says it was never notified of the contemplated action against it, adding that it was not accorded an opportunity to defend itself before the aforesaid findings and recommendations were made against it. “The first respondent (Parliament) has inimically subsumed the role of the investigating agencies, the arbiters and concluded that the funds paid to the applicant were ostensibly unlawfully paid, in directing the third interested party (IEBC) to take immediate legal action to recover sums purportedly, unlawfully paid under the contract(s) entered into between themselves,” argued Lusi. Idemia is the technology giant behind the ongoing Huduma Namba registration in the country.  The firm won a Sh1.7 billion tender to supply 31,500 biometric kits for the exercise.
