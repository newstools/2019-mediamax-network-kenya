Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin Lamu residents will wait until next month to know the fate of a Sh200 billion coal-fired power plant in their backyard as pressure piles on the government to review the infrastructure project. This is after the National Environment Tribunal (NET) yesterday failed to give a ruling on a pending case, where the issuance of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) licence has been challenged. National Environment Management Authority has been faulted for issuing an EIA licence, dated September 7, 2016, to the developer-Amu Power for construction of the 1,050 MW coal plant, despite potential environmental effects, health issues, unresolved land matters and lack of public participation in the process. Environment effects Locals together with eight Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have petitioned the government to stop the construction of the plant, citing harmful environmental effects. “The judgment is not ready,” the tribunal told a disappointed lot in Nairobi, which included Lamu residents who had travelled over 700 kilometres to the city for the verdict. The locals whom a huge section of their economy is dependent on the ocean are concerned that, should a coal-fired power plant be up and operational in the region, it will lead to environmental degradation affecting their livelihoods. This is mainly fishing activities and mangrove forests across the coastal line. Locals have also argued that the location of the project contravenes land allocation requirements as set out in public land laws. “Public land that falls within mangroves, wetlands, riparian areas, the territorial sea, is along beaches or falls within environmentally sensitive areas should not be allocated for development under our land laws,” residents argue in a section of their petition.
