DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Three county governments and the World Bank yesterday signed a Sh20 billion Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project agreements. Witnessed by the Deputy President William Ruto (pictured), the initiative is aimed at improving access to water, healthcare, education and building resilience of communities in Garissa, Wajir and Turkana. The first agreement was Sh10 billion for Water and Sanitation programmes in Garissa and Wajir Counties while the second, of a similar amount, seeks to improve social services and expand economic opportunities for communities in the three counties that host refugees. Speaking after the signing ceremony at the Harambee Annex Office, Ruto said the government, in collaboration with the World Bank, was committed to the transformation of arid and semi arid areas.
