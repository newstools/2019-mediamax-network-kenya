Wazito are back to the top of National Super League standings after beating Fortune Sacco 2-0 away at Thika Stadium yesterday. Derrick Onyango and Victor Onyango scored through headers in either half for the win which leaves Wazito on 66 points.  The win is a relief to Wazito who were beaten 5-2 by Kenya Police in midweek. Fortune Sacco were a stubborn outfit for large chunks of the match with their lead striker Stephen Onyango a constant threat. However, the central defence pairing of Dennis Gicheru and Lloyd Wahome stood firm. Following a barren draw between Ushuru and hosts Kisumu Allstars on Saturday, the lakeside team now drops to second with 65 points while Nairobi Stima, who won 1-0 against Nairobi City Stars, are third with 64 points. Meanwhile, Kenya Police recovered brilliantly to beat Shabana 4-2 at Karuturi Stadium following their midweek debacle.  The law enforcers are, however, stuck at fifth place with 59 points and still with an outside chance of clinching a playoff spot in what has been a formidable season. Elsewhere, Administration Police (AP) beat Kangemi Allstars 1-0 at Hope Centre to push them to 46 points.  Hillary Otieno’s first half strike was the difference and in the match as the  result keeps AP in the top 10. Victory was a morale booster to AP who endured a frustrating 2-2 draw with City Stars in midweek. In another fixture, relegation-threatened Green Commandos secured an important 1-0 win away to Kibera Black Stars.
