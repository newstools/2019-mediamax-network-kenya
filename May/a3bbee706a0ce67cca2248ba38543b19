Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu The Senate Committee on Energy has called for speedy installation of leak detection equipment on the Sh48 billion Mombasa-Nairobi line five pipeline project. Speaking during a familiarisation tour at the Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited (KPRL) and the Kenya Pipeline Company in Changamwe, Mombasa, committee chairman Ephraim Maina said lack of the safeguard exposes the nation to huge loss. Statistics show that the country incurs a Sh1.5 billion loss annually as a result of leakages. “The equipment should have been put like yesterday.  And it is not that expensive. I have heard some people say that it is expensive, it is not compared to the amount of loss the country incurs without the equipment,” he said. KPRL acting general manager in charge of operations and maintenance Joshua Mutea said repairing a leakage takes Kenya Pipeline Company approximately six hours which translates to a loss of more than 600 million litres of oil given that line five pumps one million litres every hour.
