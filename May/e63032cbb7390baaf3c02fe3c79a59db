He directed the Ministry of Water and Sanitation to ensure that Water Resources Authority (WRA), the body charged with regulations, to play a leading role in protecting forest cover. Despite continued reforestation efforts through the years, and pronouncements by top government officials, Kenya’s forest cover is still below the global threshold of 10 per cent. According to Kenya Forest Service, the cover stands at 7 per cent. “I am directing Water Resources Authority to ensure it charges levies for water used across the country. That levy then must be used to manage the entire ecosystem of the water availability and provision,” said Ruto yesterday, during the official opening ceremony of an international water forum at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi.
