Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Capital Markets Authority (CMA) wants measures put in place to enhance the competitiveness of market infrastructure and intermediaries. It said improved infrastructure would ensure smooth and efficient operations of the markets in the country. Capital markets infrastructure includes, systems, institutions, resources and platforms that support the efficient operation of the market and promotes critical services for efficient trading. Luke Ombara, director, Regulatory Policy and Strategy, at CMA said Kenya’s capital markets have in the last six months experienced challenges which led to the suspension of trading for hours. The last system outage was the third in a span of six months, following similar collapses in January this year and October last year. Early last month, market turnover dropped 57.4 percent to Sh369 million compared to Sh865.3 million recorded the previous week, indicating heavy investor losses from the system glitch. The system failures have left NSE investors counting heavy losses. Ombara said Kenya’s capital markets have experienced a number of incidents, where trading had to be postponed following the hiccups. While suspension led to losses, Ombara said to avoid any of such happening in future, capital markets need to have adequate infrastructures to enable smooth operations. Ombara asked Nairobi Securities Exchange and Central Depository and Settlement Corporation to fast-track the upgrade of their systems  to ensure a more efficient and liquid local capital market.
