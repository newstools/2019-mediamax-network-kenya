Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Shelter Afrique has invested $2 million (Sh200 million) in the Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company to support development of affordable housing as contained in the Big Four agenda. Andrew Chimphondah, the chief executive officer of the Pan African mortgage lender, said many Kenyans would like to own houses but do not have access to affordable finance. “We are encouraged by the formation of the Mortgage Refinance Company which provides long-term lending to commercial banks, microfinance banks and saccos to allow them to extend mortgage loans to the eligible public over a longer period and at a lower cost,” he said. Chimphondah said the money will enhance affordability and boosts uptake of housing. He said that lack of affordability explains the reasons why there were only 24,000 active mortgages in Kenya despite the country having a housing shortage of over two million units. “If 100 Kenyans apply for mortgages, only five will qualify because of lack of affordability; 10 might be due to high credit risk, but the majority will be disqualified on the basis that they wouldn’t be able to meet their mortgage repayments,” he said. Chimphondah lauded the government’s efforts to provide free land to developers and also for undertaking to provide necessary infrastructure for housing development, under its affordable housing plan, which seeks to develop 500,000 housing units by the year 2022. Free land “Cost of land constitutes about 40 per cent of the total cost of a housing unit and with the government undertaking to provide free land this means a discount of equal margins on the units already,” he said. “Through such initiatives, it is possible to develop housing units costing as low as Sh1.5 million, which I believe would be affordable to many Kenyans,” Chimphondah added. Shelter Afrique is the latest lender to join the list of banks that are angling for a share of the housing billions that the Big Four agenda will provide.
