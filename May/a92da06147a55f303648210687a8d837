The new Kisumu Public Service Board leadership has promised to sanitise the county’s workforce. Board chairman Charles Karan said the board will conduct an appraisal after assuming office to regularise staff deployment. He said the evaluation process seeks to weed out irregularly recruited staff. Karan maintained all county government employees would be subjected to the performance review to ascertain their duties in the public service. He said positions found to be illegally held by some workers would be readvertised, adding that the exercise is intended to improve service delivery to residents. “It is not going to be business as usual. We want to ensure the county’s human resource is properly regularised and that everybody is put where they belong,” he said. Karan spoke yesterday when he and five other board members took oath of office in a ceremony presided by Kisumu Resident magistrate Beryl Omollo. The board members are Jacinta Kapiyo, Stephen Orot, Edward Kochung, Nashon Aluoka and Jane Oyare. The members’ list was unanimously passed by MCAs on April 11 after a vetting exercise by the Assembly’s Labour and Social Welfare committee. The board, Karan said, would be guided by professionalism and observe the rule of fair justice administration while delivering its mandate. “We would wish to peg our service delivery on policies and operate free of political interference,” he added. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o reiterated that the board members were recruited in a fair, competitive and rigorous exercise. He urged for discipline and commitment among civil servants.  County secretary Olango Onudi said constitution of the board was a reprieve to the county, whose key operations had stalled in its absence.
