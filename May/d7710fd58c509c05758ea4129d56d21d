Anthony Mwangi and Wangari Njuguna @PeopleDailyKe The planned prayer meeting organised by MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto MPs tomorrow in Murang’a has been called off for the second time, following intervention by Harambee House. A source involved in organising the gathering told People Daily that the leadership of the Jubilee Party in Parliament found it prudent to call off the meeting  as it would have polarised the country politically. “Even before the call from the Office of the President, the leadership had decided to cancel the meeting. After consulting it became evident it would have been perceived to be a contest between the President and his deputy,” said the source, who holds a position in the House leadership. It is the second time the prayer meeting has been called off. Two weeks ago, it was cancelled to allow the MPs to attend the funeral of former President Moi’s son Jonathan. A list seen by People Daily on Wednesday had the names of 168 legislators, who had confirmed attendance as at 7pm. “The meeting would have been the turning point of Kenya’s politics, even Nasa MPs who support the DP had confirmed attendance,” added the source. Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, who was among those involved in planning the meeting, however, denied that the team was forced to cancel the prayer rally, saying the move was taken because the timing was wrong. “We simply decided to postpone the meeting until the rains subside,” he said. “A new date shall be set after which we shall notify the public,” he added. The meeting, according to organisers, was meant to focus on national cohesion and integration and pray for Ruto. The DP’s office, however,  said Ruto was not aware of the meeting, even as the organisers insisted he would have been the chief guest at the public event.
