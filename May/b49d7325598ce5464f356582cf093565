Irate residents on Tuesday hacked to death a chief and set his body ablaze at Kamaindi in Tharaka Nithi county. Josphat Mukengu was flushed out of  his house by residents who accused him of killing a neighbour and burying his body near river Thuci last year. The residents also accused him of failing to intervene to have his brother release goats confined in his compound after they grazed on his farm. Main problem “People have been having issues with the chief, I think the issue of goats was not the main problem. There have been reports that the administrator and his brother killed a resident, who went missing last December only for his remains to be recovered last month buried near a river,” said a neighbour. Area County Commissioner Beverly Opworah said police have launched investigation into the motive of the crime. Speaking to People Daily some residents who declined to be identified accused the administrator and his brother of  harassing and barring them from accessing the river which cuts through their land. They said trouble started last year when the family diverted water from the river to their farm, denying residents downstream  access to water for domestic use. The family of the administrator has called on the government to provide them with security, saying they fear for their lives. The chief’s brother has already fled his home after he allegedly received threats from unknown people yesterday. Meanwhile, a Marsabit Ward Rep collapsed and died on Monday night. Loiyangalani MCA Mark Ekare died while attending a meeting in Mombasa.
