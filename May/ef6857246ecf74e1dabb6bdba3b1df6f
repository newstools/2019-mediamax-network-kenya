In what could be a case of deja vu, Nairobi Stima seem to be imploding at the wrong time given the National Super League title race and promotion quest is entering homestretch. Stima have picked six points out of a possible 15, bringing to mind memories of last year when they were among the top two teams for most of the season, only to fizzle out at the crucial moment, missing out on promotion altogether. However, the situation is not so bad for George Owoko’s men as they sit fourth on the 20-team table with 55 points, five behind joint leaders Kisumu All Stars and Wazito FC and with nine games remaining, promotion is still within reach. “We must get our groove back because these are crucial times. Dropping points has been costly since we are chasing promotion, however, we can make it right. I want to bring back belief and hopefully, we will get a win,” said Owoko, who has forwards Dennis Oalo and Victor Omune to call on for today’s match against FC Talanta. Meanwhile, All Stars and Wazito also have tricky fixtures against Eldoret Youth and Modern Coast Rangers respectively. The lakeside outfit host a stubborn Eldoret Youth who sit 11th on the table and will have revenge on their minds, having lost 1-0 in the corresponding fixture. Elsewhere, third-placed Ushuru, one point behind the leaders, will be in Thika to take on seventh-placed Bidco United, who have been enjoying a good home record this season.
