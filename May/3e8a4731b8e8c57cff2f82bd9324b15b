By Nancy Gitonga Businessman Jared Otieno will have to spend another seven days at Kileleshwa Police Station to allow police complete investigations into a scandal involving fake gold.
This is after Milimanai Senior Resident Magistrate Paul Mayova Friday ruled that seven days were sufficient for police to complete investigations. According to the police affidavit, investigations into a case of obtaining money by false pretences is ongoing. Two weeks ago, police raided a house allegedly owned by Otieno and arrested 15 people in connection with the fraud. They were produced before a Nairobi court and orders to detain them granted. According to the police, Otieno is linked to many more fraudulent activities involving fake gold and that there are many more complainants who have come up with similar allegations. Investigating officer Felix Karisa said on February 25, 2019 and May 8, 2019 a foreigner Southern Chanthavong from Lao who deals in buying and selling of gold is alleged to have been lured to a Kaptei Gardens house on Kaptei Road.
“During the transaction the complainant lost $3,000,000 (Sh300 million) after he was duped that the items he bought were genuine gold,” said Karisa
The investigations are said to be complex, diverse and are looking at transnational organised crime where some of his accomplices could be in the neighbouring countries and the offences committed cuts across international borders.
