Kisumu Oil Jetty is set to start operations in three months,Petroleum Cabinet secretary John Munyes has said. Munyes announced on Monday that the Sh1.9 billion  jetty will be up and running by August. He said construction work on the facility which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta about one year ago is complete and is already equipped with state -of-the-art equipment. Munyes said the timelines have been guaranteed after Ugandan authorities announced it would complete its side of the jetty within two months. The facility, he said, has been inspected and certified by National Oil Corporation after meeting the required standards. Munyes also reassured on the quality of the jetty, saying that reports from experts and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) certification rated it as one of the best constructed jetties in the region. “We are ready to go and I can confirm that Kenyans will see the Kisumu jetty usable in two months after Ugandan side completes theirs,” he said, adding that the facility would be tested before the commissioning. Speaking in Kisumu, Munyes said the jetty is going to be a viable investment for the region as it is expected to ease fuel transportation to Uganda and other East African neighbouring countries. Facilitate transport The jetty is expected to facilitate transport of petroleum products through Lake Victoria to neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Eastern DRC and parts of Tanzania. Munyes said Kenya would export a vessel of 4.4 million litres of oil through the jetty once it becomes operational, adding that the jetty would operate two vessels per day.
