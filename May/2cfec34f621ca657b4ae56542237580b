Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu United States, China, Malaysia and some Middle East countries are some of the states that have shown interests in purchasing Kenya’s crude oil. Petroleum and Mining Cabinet Secretary John Munyes said samples of the crude oil have already been tested and confirmed to be “one of the best.” In an exclusive interview with Business Hub on the sidelines of the 9th East African Petroleum Conference and Exhibition, 2019 in Mombasa, Munyes said Middle East and China are the leading potential markets. He said Kenya has already identified the potential market and is discussing with them. “The moment we collect enough barrels, we will weigh which price is good and which country has what demand and then we will start pushing it for these markets,” he said.  The crude, the CS added, will be sold to the highest bidder.” Munyes (pictured) said Kenya expects to hit the target of 200,000 barrels – an equivalent of 23,469,553.16 litres  – by next month when it will flag off its first crude oil shipment. Storage tanks So far 87,000 barrels of crude oil, an equivalent of 10,209,255.6 litres of oil truck from Lokichar oilfields in Turkana county, have been collected at the Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd storage tanks in Mombasa. “We have already done the testing and we know how valuable our crude is. The moment we attain the 200,000 barrels by June we will have known which country to sell our oil,” he said. Munyes said full field development plan for Kenya crude oil pipeline is expected by the end of this year. “We are working on agreements for lenders to give us money. We are also securing land where by so far we have done so in five counties, though Turkana is still being discussed,” he added. “We are also securing the water. Between now and 2021, we need to address those issues. The moment they are cleared then we are on course,” Munyes said.
