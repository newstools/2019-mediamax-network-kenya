ADALLA ALLAN I am still reminiscing on the recent syrupy Easter vacation spent at the home of longtime friend Brian Kimathi along Kiambu road where we’d been hosted for a wiener roast. No one dared turn down this once in a blue moon offer that came mid-month when people are known to be penniless and not forgetting the long drought. I rushed to Kencom bus stop for our 2pm meet up with the gang as agreed. My friend Mike a car enthusiast, was behind the wheel. On approaching a police check just a stone’s throw from the DCI headquarters; it sprang on Mike’s mind that he had forgotten to carry his driving licence. After flagging us down, the police officer, a fleshy short and dark fellow whom one would fairly describe as ‘kijana nono fupi round’, majestically walked towards our car. He soberly checked the insurance sticker before asking for the driving licence from the driver in the vernacular accent typical of police officers ‘‘kijana wapi driving licence?’’ The driver answered in a shaking voice, “nimesahau nyumbani afande,’’ (“It’s at home officer”) After a thoughtful moment, the officer finally asked for any evidence that he has a valid driving licence. Mike then downloaded a soft copy of his valid driving licence from the NTSA app and showed it to the officer. The Traffic Act, Section 36, regarding provision of a driving licence on demand, states that any person driving a motor vehicle on a road shall carry his driving license or provisional driving license and produce the same to police when required and the document should include such other evidence as will satisfy the police that there is no contravention of Section 30 regarding licensing of drivers. Any person who fails to comply with this section shall be guilty of an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding Sh10,000.
