Limuru Member of Parliament Peter Mwathi has hailed some churches for spearheading the fight against corruption. The legislator challenged other churches to follow suit and speak out against the vice, saying the fight should not be left to the DCI, DPP and Judiciary. Addressing hawkers in Limuru town yesterday, Mwathi cautioned leaders against politicising the war against corruption adding that there should be no sacred cows. “As it has been said by leaders from across the political spectrum including President Uhuru Kenyatta, corruption is not done by communities but individuals and those found culpable should carry their own crosses,” he said. Expedite cases The MP, at the same time, urged the Judiciary to expedite corruption cases, saying “corruption fights back and more so when given room to breathe”. Mwathi waded into graft allegations in Kiambu county and said leaders should account for not just the money sent to the devolved unit from the national Treasury but also the revenue collected from the people. Meanwhile, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said the war against corruption was becoming a distraction that could make Mt Kenya region lose focus of the area’s political future. “My take is that due process must be followed. If Waititu is found to have misappropriated county funds, I will be the first to crucify him but if otherwise, I will be the first to sanitise him,” he said during burial of KBC reporter Tom Kimani’s father in Ndumberi, Kiambu county.
