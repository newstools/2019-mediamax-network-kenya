Portland, Tuesday @PeopleSport11 Stephen Curry and Draymond Green both posted triple-doubles to power the Golden State Warriors to a 119-117 overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday and into a fifth straight NBA Finals. The two-time defending NBA champions swept the Blazers in four games in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals. The only other team to reach five straight NBA Finals was the Boston Celtics, when they went to a record 10 in a row from 1957 to 1966. “I hope it doesn’t go unnoticed or underrated – five straight finals hasn’t been done since the 60s,” said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “It hasn’t been done for a reason, it’s really, really difficult and so I just can’t say enough about the competitive desire of the group of guys that we have here.” Triple-doubles The Warriors will battle for the title starting on May 30 against either the Milwaukee Bucks or Toronto Raptors, aiming to become the first team since the Los Angeles Lakers of 2000, 2001 and 2002 to three-peat as champions. Curry and Green became the first teammates in league history to have triple-doubles in the same post-season game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Curry finished with 37 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists, while Green had his second straight triple-double – posting double digits in three key statistical categories – with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. Fittingly, Curry and Green combined on the game-winning basket in overtime, Curry feeding Green for a three-pointer that pushed Golden State to a 119-115 lead with 39.6 seconds left in overtime. “Obviously, in that situation we want Steph to have the ball, we want Steph or Klay (Thompson) to take the shot,” Green said. “But they were swarming them. So I was just talking to them ‘Watch out, watch out.’’ – AFP
