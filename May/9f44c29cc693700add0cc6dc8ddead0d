The controversy-ridden Kiru Tea Factory in Murang’a county is demanding Sh20 million from four of its directors and two senior officials of the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) over the abortive boardroom coup against its chairman, Chege Kirundi. The 8,000-member firm, through lawyer Kithinji Marete, is seeking to recoup legal costs from the four directors, KTDA chief executive  Lerionka ole Tiampati and company secretary John Omanga, who were found guilty of flouting Court of Appeal orders blocking them from engineering Kirundi’s removal. The six officials have already paid fines amounting to Sh2.4 million imposed on them by the Appellate judges William Ouko, Fatuma Sichale and John Otieno-Odek after they were convicted of acting in contempt of court. Each of them was fined Sh400,000 or to serve seven-month jail-terms in default. Bill of costs Marete has filed the bill of costs against Tiampati, Omanga, Stephen Githiga, Easton Gakungu, Peter Kinyua and Francis Macharia. The legal costs include instruction fees for senior counsel Paul Muite, who argued on behalf of the factory the six consecutive applications that were filed by the six officials to thwart the contempt proceedings.
