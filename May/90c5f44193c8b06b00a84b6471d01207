Two title contenders in the National Super League (NSL) face off Saturday with stakes high as the competition nears its end. Leaders Kisumu Allstars welcome fourth-placed Ushuru at the Moi Stadium fortress in the lakeside city with an eye on opening their one point gap at the top. Ushuru who are on fourth spot with 59 points have had a couple of mishaps in recent times including their midweek 2-1 loss to FC Talanta and will be keen to improve. With only seven rounds to end the 2018/19 campaigns, the taxmen are feeling the pressure not to miss out on promotion at the third consecutive attempt. The Allstars who have picked four points in their immediate past two matches however have different plans and according to coach Francis Oduor, only three points would count after their 1-1 draw in the corresponding fixture earlier in the season. “We are ready and prepared to do the business at home. Being at our backyard with our fans behind us is an advantage. It will be a tough fixture because they are experienced but I have spoken to my players and for us it is a win we are eyeing,” he told People Sport on phone. Meanwhile Wazito travel to unpredictable Fortune Sacco Sunday in an evening fixture at Thika Stadium. Wazito on 63 points will be out to hunt for a win against the league newcomers who are 13th on the log. Following their midweek 5-2 thrashing of fifth-placed Kenya Police, Fred Ambani’s charges should pose a huge and likely threat to their hosts.
