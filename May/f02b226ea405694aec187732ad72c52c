Josphat Kinyua @josphatkinyua Poor prices at coffee auction are set to dampen farmers fortunes. Despite low production last year, coffee is fetching an all-time low of $120 (Sh12,141.6) per 50-kilogramme bag of clean coffee in the Nairobi exchange. To add insult to the injury most of the produce is returning no bid in the weekly auction a situation which is putting government efforts of reviving the sector into doubts. The low prices are in contrast to the 2016/17 season where the average buying price of a 50kg bag of AA and AB grade of clean coffee was fetching between $400 (Sh40,472) and $700 (Sh70,826), which saw most farmers receive Sh80 to Sh100 per kg of cherry delivered. Most cooperative society managers say that the highest paid factory can only afford to pay its farmers a maximum of Sh80 for a kilogramme of cherry delivered with farmers who delivered low grade coffee contending with as little as Sh30 per kg. The government has announced that Sh3 billion has been factored into the 2019/20 Financial Year Budget to revive the sector.
