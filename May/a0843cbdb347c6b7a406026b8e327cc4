Authorities at the Coast region are on high alert over the resurgence of the outlawed Mombasa Republican Council (MRC). Cops spent the better part of the weekend combing Kaloleni in search of suspected MRC members who escaped a police dragnet on Saturday. Kaloleni OCPD, Kennedy Osanda, said members of the outlawed group had begun regrouping in various parts of coast region raising serious security concerns. He said that police were yet to establish their motivation but investigations were ongoing. On Friday last week, police acting on intelligence reports, raided a training camp in Kaya Jibana and arrested three youths who were part of more than 50 youths believed to have been undergoing an oathing exercise. Osanda said among those arrested was a witch doctor who was carrying out the oathing exercise alongside his son. Police recovered a cache of weapons, including 10 pangas, arrows and bows as well as blood and red strips of cloth. “We ask the public to be on the lookout for anyone who conducting burial in the area and inform the police to enable us bring to book suspects who are still at large,” he said.
