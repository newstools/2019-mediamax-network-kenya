Armed rebels have attacked a village in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo killing six people, and there are fears that dozens of others were abducted. A DR Congo military spokesman blamed Wednesday’s attack in Ituri Province’s Tshabi village on the Allied Democratic Front (ADF) – a rebel group that originated in Uganda. Congolese soldiers are reported to have fought the rebels for more than an hour. A spokesman said five of the attackers were killed and one soldier died. A traditional chief in the area says 30 people from the village are still missing and are feared to have been kidnapped by the rebels, who also looted 100 cattle. -BBC
