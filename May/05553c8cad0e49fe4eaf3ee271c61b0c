Football Kenya Federation (FKF) insist Women’s Premier League (WPL) matches will continue as scheduled despite the clubs issuing a strike notice on Tuesday. The 13 sides from the 16-team league, represented by their club officials,  on Tuesday resolved to stop honouring matches starting this weekend until concerns they have shared with the federation are addressed. In response to the communication from the clubs, the federation, through Secretary General Robert Muthomi, wrote to the teams seeking to establish whether the said officials had consent from the teams and whether the clubs agree with the decisions made during the Tuesday meeting. FKF’s ultimatum “We are in receipt of communication originating from a purported meeting held by a section of the Kenyan WPL. FKF hereby requests you to confirm that your club gave consent for the mentioned club official to attend the meeting in Nakuru and that you are in agreement with the decisions made by the club officials present during the meeting,” read part of the letter sent to all clubs who were represented in the said meeting. The clubs were given 48 hours to respond to the letter in order for FKF to make pertinent decisions regarding the WPL as soon as possible. “Further be guided that as per the FKF Rules Governing Kenyan Football Art2.3 (c), only National Executive Committee has the powers to suspend or extend a league/season and as such we wish to confirm that the Kenyan WPL matches scheduled for this weekend and subsequent league matches shall proceed as scheduled,” the letter further read. According to the club officials, all 13 clubs received the letter from FKF and are yet to respond. “All 13 teams have the letter but the resolve is not to be bowed until our issues are addressed. Clubs are having a hard time honouring league matches and top of our issues is the grants that were meant to be availed two weeks into the season,” said a club official.
