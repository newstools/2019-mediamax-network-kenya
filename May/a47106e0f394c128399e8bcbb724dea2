Kenya imports between 60 and 70 per cent of all  drugs used in the country. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said the trend must be addressed in order for the government to achieve the Universal Health Coverage plan. Addressing the press in Kikuyu constituency after touring Universal Corporation Company that manufactures drugs including ARVs, Kariuki said the country has the capacity to manufacture enough drugs as opposed to importing them. Big Four “We have at least 34 manufacturers of human drugs in the country and we as a government are doing all we can to buy their products in the spirit of buy Kenya build Kenya,” she said. During the visit, it was revealed that 80 per cent of drugs made by the company are exported. The CS further said the government would address tariffs on drugs in the East African Community in order to encourage investors in the industry. “A company like this one has employed 370 employees and therefore, investors should be encouraged to set up their businesses in the country to create more jobs,” she said. On money owed to Kenya Medical Supplies Authority by counties, the CS said respective counties should ensure they offset their debts to address drugs shortage in the health facailities. Health is one of the four pillars of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda which, Kariuki said,  the government is committed to achieving.
