Bernard Gitau @benagitau The  National Parents Association has backed the implementation of the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) despite challenges  facing it. The association’s chair Nicholas Maiyo said as parents’ representatives, they want the best education for their children. “The education wheel continues to roll and as your leaders, we join you in seeking that it turns at the right speed and in the right direction,” said Maiyo. Challenges Speaking at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Maiyo acknowledged that the implementation of the new curriculum is facing many challenges including resistance by the Kenya National Union of Teachers, low public participation and parents sensitisation. Maiyo urged the Education ministry to bring all stakeholders on board and help the association to enlighten its member on their specific roles under the CBC. “We understand that parents will now be more involved in the education delivery process than  in the past,” he said.
