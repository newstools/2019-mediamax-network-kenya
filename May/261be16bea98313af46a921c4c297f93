New kid on the block Dar Mjomba, a Genius Records signee, is making strides in the game. He first released Niombee, which talked about the journey of his life, then later did a collabo with Weezdom. His latest song Pesa is a testimony to his growth musically and it’s already getting media attention. “Pesa is a story about being a normal human being and wanting material things, which is okay, but I am reminding people that despite everything, we should put God first,” he told Spice. Jacky B produced the audio and he did it justice with the mastering, something that was absent in the young artiste’s first tracks. Dantey directed the video for Genius Visuals and the vintage feeling on the start is a beauty when it comes to cinematography. Rating 7/10.
