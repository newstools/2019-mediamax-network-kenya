Alvin Kariuki and PSCU @PeopleDailyKe First Lady Margaret Kenyatta yesterday urged governments to invest more resources in public health nursing to meet aspirations of high quality healthcare provision for all. She said public health nursing is central to the functioning of any health system and should  be adequately resourced in terms of manpower, equipment and continuous capacity building. Intensify training “It will benefit our healthcare systems if we invest in building a strong cadre of public health nurses, through rigorous training, specialisation and practice to enhance their skills,” she said. Margaret, who spoke when she presided the official opening of the 5th Global Network for Public Health Nursing (GNPHN) conference at a Nairobi hotel, expressed gratitude that the country has intensified training, development and deployment of public nurses. “In my work and visits to health centres across Kenya, I have witnessed the role of nurses and community health workers as key influencers in the health and wellbeing of patients, communities and the populations they serve,” she said.
