Sydney, Thursday @PeopleSport11 Australian billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest could offer Israel Folau a career lifeline in Asia if the star Wallaby’s contract is terminated over his homophobic comments, it was reported Thursday. Tonga coach Toutai Kefu has also said he is keen for Folau to switch allegiance to his team, even though the fullback would have to serve a three-year stand-down period to be eligible. The devoutly Christian player was found guilty this week of a “high-level” breach of the sport’s code of conduct after posting an anti-gay statement on social media, leaving his career hanging in the balance. The 30-year-old has limited options if his lucrative Rugby Australia contract is torn up, with the National Rugby League ruling out signing him and many overseas rugby clubs shying away from his anti-gay views. But Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported that Forrest, himself a committed Christian, could find a spot for Folau in his Global Rapid Rugby competition, which is set to kick off next year. Marquee player It said the competition was interested in making the fullback a marquee signing for either the Hong Kong-based South China Tigers or the Singapore-based Asia Pacific Dragons. “Global Rapid Rugby has spoken to a number of talented international players and will continue to do so,” a spokesman for the competition told AFP when asked about Folau. “No contracts have been offered to any players.” He added that marquee players were likely to be a part of the competition. Global Rapid Rugby, a fast-paced game with radical new rules, was set up by mining magnate Forrest after his beloved Western Force were cut from the Super Rugby competition in 2017. – Play for free – An eight-team, 56-game competition is due to begin in 2020 after its launch was delayed by 12 months because of this year’s World Cup in Japan.   – AFP
