Los Angeles, Thursday @PeopleSport11 First, there was a grunt behind the walls of the Toronto Raptors’ locker room. Then, three loud bangs of a frustrated fist. It’s far too early for regrets, but the Raptors knew Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals — a 108-100 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night — was the one to steal. Instead, rested legs prevailed against a team playing in the rhythm of high-intensity playoff basketball. Or, more pointedly, Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry could not beat a deep Bucks squad alone, as their Raptors teammates combined to hit one field goal in the second half. That’s right, one, thanks to a Pascal Siakam bucket in the third quarter. Near-perfect Coming in off the emotionally draining series victory against the Philadelphia 76ers, the Raptors seemed to play a near-perfect three quarters. The much-maligned Lowry hit seven of nine triples for 30 points and made critical plays to keep the momentum from fading quicker than it did. “He was great,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of Lowry. “It’s been awhile since he had one of those nights where every time he pulled up you thought he was going to make it. He was fighting like heck out there.” Leonard, who could be a tired man a week from now due to his workload and heavy usage, cobbled together a 31-point performance on 26 shots. A little more from the fringes and the Raptors could’ve snatched home-court advantage from the conference final novices with the NBA’s best record. But a 32-17 fourth-quarter surge from the Bucks was the difference, with Brook Lopez emerging from his playoff slumber to score 13 of his team-high 29 points to push his team to a 1-0 series lead. “No, we had a couple days off, we were good,” Raptors swingman Danny Green told Yahoo Sports, dismissing the notion of tired legs. “This is a young team, a professional team. It’s the Eastern Conference finals, we were supposed to come in with energy, regardless of the last series. It’s irrelevant now.” – AFP
