Joshua Khisa @CeejayCheloti More than 100 pupils of Mitoto Primary School in Kitale town were yesterday rushed to Kitale County Hospital, where they were treated for suspected cholera infection. A  teacher from the school was also admitted at the facility with symptoms of the disease.  The hospital’s acting Medical Superintendent Lilian Lipesa said cholera tests turned negative. “We are carrying out more blood tests to ascertain the ailment,” she said, adding that the pupils showed signs of cholera including diarrhoea and vomiting when they were taken to the hospital. The medic said the cases could have arisen from food poisoning or water contamination. She however said the pupils and the teacher were in stable condition and were to be discharged yesterday evening. Saboti sub-county disease surveillance officer Stanley Kirwa said the outbreak could have arisen from sewage spillage in the area. He said public health officers were sent to the area to identify the cause of the outbreak. The officers, he said, are also conducting community sensitisation and chlorination of water sources in the area where the outbreak was reported. Lipesa said medics at the facility were performing culture tests on the samples and results are expected today. Parents, whose children were  affected, stormed the school  and blamed its management for failure to improve hygiene. They threatened to withdraw their children from the facility.
