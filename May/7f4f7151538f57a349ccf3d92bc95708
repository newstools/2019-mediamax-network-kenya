Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe A senator, three politicians and at least three lawyers are suspected to be colluding with gold fraudsters to con unsuspecting foreigners of billions of shillings by selling them fake gold. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti (pictured) has formed a special team to investigate the scam and warned foreigners to consult the police and the Department of Geology whenever they intend to purchase gold. “The gold scam has now reached alarming levels as unsuspecting foreigners are being swindled large amounts of money by fraudsters,” he said. Recently, the Vice President and Prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, and ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, wrote to the Government of Kenya to protest against the scam and demanded action. Kinoti said the fraudsters had even leased premises at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and were using unscrupulous government officials to facilitate their movements at the airports and government offices.
