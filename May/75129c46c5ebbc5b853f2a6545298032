The tablets distributed under the Digital Learning Programme are either underutilised or not used at all in most public primary schools in Kwale county. The revelation by the County Director of Education Jane Njogu today shocked the County Development Implementation and Coordination Committee which demanded a proper explanation on the status of the programme in the region. Njogu, who was hard put to explain to the committee why teachers were not using the devices to teach, seemed to shift the blame to the teachersâ€™ employer, the Teachers Service Commission. The TSC, the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) and the Information Communications and Technology Authority are the key government agencies responsible for the school tablet project. Despite public schools having ICT facilities, only a few use them in enhancing teaching and learning, according to KICD report which notes that only 39 per cent of the teachers used the gadgets to teach. Kepsha branch chairman Chirima Mgala conceded that the project had ran into headwinds in some schools due to shortage of teachers trained to handle the gadgets.
