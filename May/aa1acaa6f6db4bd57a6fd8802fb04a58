Ronald Mwadzombo @PeopleDailyKe Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha says he is planning to meet Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) in regard to its opposition to the implementation of the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC). Magoha said the window of stakeholder’s engagement on CBC is still open and no one will be left out to ensure its success. The CS, however, reiterated that the implementation of the new curriculum is unstoppable. Knut is opposed to implementation of CBC and had asked teachers to boycott the training on the same. However, teachers ignored the directive. Magoha said the programme is progressing on well and no one can stop it or force the government to start it afresh. The CS spoke at Pwani University in Kilifi county on Wednesday after addressing senior education officials, who are currently undergoing training on the programme. Magoha also dismissed critics who have accused the government of not engaging all stakeholders on CBC, saying the process is still ongoing. The CS said 200,000 more teachers will be trained in August to add up to the 91,000 who underwent the programme in April.
