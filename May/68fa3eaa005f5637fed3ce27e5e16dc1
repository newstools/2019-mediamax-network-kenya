Dickens Wasonga Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has replaced his County Executive Committee (CEC) member for Health Rosemary Obara and nominated  Prof Judith Atiang’ to replace her. The news of Obara’s replacement was shared by the director of the governor’s press unit Aloyce Ager on a WhatsApp page belonging to Kisumu-based journalists. But a source close to the governor told People Daily that Obara resigned due to pressure of work. Attempts to reach her for comment Friday were not successful. In a press statement, the governor described Atiang’ as a career educationist who has worked for several universities and is a member of intergovernmental relations technical committee (IGRTC). The statement said  the decision to nominate Atiang’ was aimed at enhancing the delivery of quality health and sanitation services. Obara’s stint at the county was marked by several strikes by the nurses and doctors who were pushing for better terms of employment. She, however, led the county health team in brokering a deal with health workers last month, thus preventing a doctors’ strike that would have paralysed healthcare services in the area. Obara was elevated to the position when Nyong’o won in the 2017 elections. She had previously served on several capacities in the Ministry of Health, including medical officer of health in charge of Kisumu District.
