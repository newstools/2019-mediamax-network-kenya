Juba, Tuesday Former US ambassador to Kenya Michael Ranneberger is among a team of consultants hired to help South Sudan government reverse existing US sanctions and block creation of a war crimes court. The revelation has sparked outrage among experts and campaigners who say it undermines a crucial element of the peace deal that was signed last year, following five years of a brutal civil war that has killed at least 400,000 and displaced millions. Hybrid court The two-year contract pays $3.7 million to a California-based lobby group called Gainful Solutions, which agrees, among other aims, to “delay and ultimately block establishment of the hybrid court”. Gainful Solutions is run by Ranneberger (pictured). The contract between the two parties was published in the Foreign Agents Registration Act section of the Justice Department website, Reuters news agency explains, as the act requires lobbyists acting on behalf of foreign agents in the US to register the relationship. -BBC
