Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has called for the disbandment of the  Salaries and Remuneration Commission, claiming it does not serve the interests of Kenyan workers. The said the commission has abdicated its role of being a constitutional advisory body on wages matters, and instead turned into a regulatory body. “MPs who are here today, please help us to abolish this body called SRC. It is opposed to lawmakers, State officers, workers and everyone else,” Atwoli (pictured) said during Labour Day celebrations at Nairobi’s Uhuru Park. Support referendum The unionist claimed SRC has been frustrating collective bargaining agreement talks between employers and workers, adding that Cotu would support the proposed referendum just to have the commission abolished. Atwoli  cited a case in which Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko implemented a pay rise for County Government Workers Union staff, only for the SRC to oppose the move.  He also renewed his push to have private guards given firearms to enhance security. On the Kenya-Somalia maritime territorial dispute, Atwoli noted Kenya did not draw the boundaries and called on Somalia to respect the same. “We did not draw our boundaries; they were drawn by our colonial masters…we must protect our territories,” he said.w
