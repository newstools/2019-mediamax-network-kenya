Khartoum, Wednesday Sudan’s military leaders have announced an agreement with the opposition alliance for a three-year transition period to a civilian administration. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) said the alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council. However, the two sides are yet to agree on a sovereign council—the top tier of power—where both want a majority. Sudan has been ruled by the military council since last month’s toppling of President Omar al-Bashir. Civilian government Protests that led to his downfall have continued, with a huge sit-in outside the military headquarters to demand full civilian government. Hours before the latest deal was announced, at least five protesters and a member of the security forces died in clashes in the capital, Khartoum. At a joint news conference on Monday night, Lt Gen Yasser al-Atta said a final agreement on power sharing would be signed with the opposition alliance—the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF)—within 24 hours. That would include the forming of a sovereign council which will rule the country until elections. “We vow to our people that the agreement will be completed fully within 24 hours in a way that meets the people’s aspirations,” he said. Earlier, protest movement spokesman Taha Osman said the sides had agreed on the structure of future authorities—a sovereign council, a cabinet and a legislative body. DFCF member Satea al-Hajj expressed optimism that the final details on power-sharing would be agreed, adding: “The viewpoints are close and, God willing, we will reach an agreement soon.”      -BBC
