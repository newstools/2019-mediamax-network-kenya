Some Kiambu leaders have accused Deputy President William Ruto of defending and abetting corruption. Addressing journalists in Ruiru town, former and current legislators accused Ruto of “rushing to defend” Governor  Ferdinand Waititu when he attended a church service at All Saints Komothai Catholic Church in Githunguri, last Sunday. Kiambu County government allegedly misappropriated close to Sh2.5 billion in the last financial year. Led by Gladys Chania, a former woman representative aspirant, the leaders told Ruto to keep off Kiambu matters and allow the relevant bodies to conduct investigations into the allegations. “It’s sad that a highly respected leader can stand and defend graft as Kenyans continue to wallow in poverty. This county should be dissolved forthwith and new leaders elected,” said Gitau Kuria, a local leader. They, however, said they have no confidence in the Auditor General’s report .
