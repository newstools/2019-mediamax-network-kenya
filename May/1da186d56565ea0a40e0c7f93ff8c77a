Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko yesterday called for an increase in the amount of money allocated to counties, saying they are underfunded. In his Labour Day speech at Uhuru Park, Sonko said the Council of Governors has been lobbying for more money to be transferred to counties, adding that the current 15 per cent is not enough. In particular, Sonko said he has had to struggle with the little amount allocated as his administration inherited Sh60 billion pending bills from his predecessor Evans Kidero. “County governments have not refused to deliver services. Devolved functions must come with devolved money,” he said. Sonko said his administration is also committed to increase salaries, but blamed salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) for acting as the roadblock towards implementation of their 2017 CBA. “This year we found ourselves in a unique situation when we supported a pay increase for  county government staff only for SRC to oppose it,” he said. At the same time, Sonko also reiterated his waiver of over Sh172 million arrears owed by tenants  living in houses owned by the county government. He, however, cautioned tenants to pay rent on time moving forward. The county boss said the waiver was issued to end cases of tenants being evicted from houses by cartels.
