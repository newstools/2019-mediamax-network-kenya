Daniel Ogendo Sofapaka coach John Baraza has blamed poor officiating and intimidation by fans for their 2-0 loss to title rivals Gor Mahia at the Moi Stadium in Kisumu on Sunday, a result that saw Gor open a 10-point lead at the top of the table. Both K’Ogalo goals were scored in the second half through Samuel Onyango and Rwanda international striker Jacques Tuyisenge. From video images recorded during the match, both goals seem to have been scored from off side and Baraza has vowed to lodge complains with the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is met. Baraza also complained of intimidation by the fans who even roughed up some technical bench officials and players were even denied a chance to feel the pitch before the match. “ After reviewing the videos of our match with Gor Mahia, it is clear that both goals were scored from an offside position. We have complained a lot on the levels of officiating and we will not stop seeking justice, we are lodging the complain with evidence to the football chiefs,” Baraza said. He added: “The levels of intimidation at the Moi Stadium in Kisumu are also high and make opponents feel beaten even before a match. We are going to protest and may not play Gor at the same venue again.”
