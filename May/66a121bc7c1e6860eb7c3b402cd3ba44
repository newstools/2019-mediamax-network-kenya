UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has described the area around north-eastern Nigeria as an “outpost of Daesh [Islamic State]” and has said the violence could “escalate quickly and… get out of control”, the Press Association (PA) news agency reports. He made the comments when visiting the regional city of Maiduguri as part of his five-nation tour of the continent. Mr Hunt said the rise of the Islamic State group needed to be “nipped in the bud”, PA quotes him as saying. North-east Nigeria has borne the brunt of the violence perpetrated by Islamist militant group Boko Haram. A breakaway faction of Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to IS. Mr Hunt said that the British government wanted to work closely with Nigeria to help deal with the problem. The UK has already trained 30,000 Nigerian troops and offered humanitarian and development support. The foreign secretary also pledged to help tackle climate change, saying that could help prevent the escalation of the conflict. He is due to travel on to Ethiopia and Kenya. -BBC
