By Githinji Mwangi Health services in Kirinyaga county have been paralysed after the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) withdrew the services of more than 30 doctors affiliated to it. The union said the environment at hospitals in the county is not conducive to both the doctors and patients. The union boss Ouma Oluga accompanied by other senior national officials said health workers in the county must leave their places of work with immediate effect until it would be communicated to them when the situation improves. He warned any health worker still working in facilities in Kirinyaga county is disobeying the law and should desist from admitting or treating any patient in the facilities. Oluga said the KMPD board which is the main regulator, has already advised against any patient being admitted to the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital because the environment they are working in is not safe for both the doctors and and patients. “We have come here to reinforce the board’s decision and to advise all health workers not to allow themselves to be found to be in professional misconduct,” he said. At the same time, the Senate Health committee has faulted Kirinyaga County government over the crisis at the hospital. The committee, led by its chairman Dr Michael Mbito said they are dissatisfied with the way the county government is dealing with the crisis and termed the situation as worrying. Accompanied by the committee members, Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru and MPs from the county Wangui Ngirici, John Wambugu, Kabinga Wachira and Kichimu Githinji, Mbito said the crisis should be investigated to ensure such an incident does not recur.
