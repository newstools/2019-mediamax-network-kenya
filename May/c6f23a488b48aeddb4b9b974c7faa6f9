National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale and Muslim clerics from Garissa want investigative agencies to probe allegations that some Huduma Namba registration staff are demanding bribes to offer services. Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, Duale said he had received complaints from residents over the matter. He said these are serious allegations that should not be allowed to thrive and a thorough investigation should be carried out and those found culpable sacked and prosecuted. “This is outright sabotage of government services. The government has invested billions of shillings into this programme that is absolutely free. No one should pay a coin for it,” he said. The Garissa Town MP called on chiefs, who are the registrars’ immediate supervisors, to closely monitor the progress of the exercise. The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) chair Abdulahi Salat raised similar concerns during a security meeting held at Lantern Hotel in Garissa town, attended by regional commissioner Mohamed Birik. Salat said the registration assistants were demanding bribes of between Sh1,500 and Sh 2,000. -KNA
