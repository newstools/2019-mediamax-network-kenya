Irene Githinji @gitshee The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has embarked on a mission to ensure all teachers are registered. Non-registered and deregistered members should not teach or conduct co-curricular activities, TSC secretary and CEO Nancy Macharia warned, adding that defiant schools will face stern action. In a statement issued yesterday,  Macharia said it emerged during the training of teachers on Competency Based Curriculum that some individuals, especially those teaching in private schools, are not registered as teachers. She said in some cases, Form Four graduates have been assigned to teach. Macharia has since directed TSC county directors to submit details of schools that have not complied for necessary action. Section 23 (2) of the TSC Act provides that no person should engage in the teaching service unless registered as a teacher. Each registered tutor is given a unique number upon registration. Macharia has also written to the Ministry of Education requesting its field officers to work with TSC county officials  to enforce the requirement. Physical checks And in a circular to TSC regional directors, she urged them to regularly monitor schools, especially private institutions, for compliance. She recommended physical checks, at least twice every term. “Regional Directors will be required to file termly reports to Director, Quality Assurance on the level of compliance and any action taken in cases of non-compliance,” she said. TSC reiterated that names of teachers, alongside their TSC numbers and teaching subject, should be prominently displayed in head teachers office and in the staff room at all times.
