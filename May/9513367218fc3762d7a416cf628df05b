George Kebaso @Morarak The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) yesterday gave Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC) seven days to address illegal discharge of effluent in Nairobi’s Industrial Area. “We have found out that one of the challenges of cleaning the rivers is the effluent from industries and informal settlements. What is flowing to the rivers are chemicals that we don’t have capacity to deal with. So the only way is to prevent it from flowing into these water bodies,” Nema Environment Inspector in charge of Compliance and Environment Samuel Ngaanga said. Operations stopped The environment watchdog says most industries are connected to defective sewer lines.  Last week, Nema stopped operations of five companies for polluting the environment and arrested junior officials. Nema is also pursuing the directors of the companies. Africa Apparels EPZ Limited, Mas Tannery, Far Horizon Hides and Skins, Amin Tanners and Nairobi Tanners Limited’s operating licenses were revoked until they comply with the Environmental Management and Coordination Act (EMCA) 1999. Nema says ongoing efforts to end pollution by industries are geared towards enforcing a presidential directive to clean the country’s rivers and other water bodies, starting with Nairobi county as the pilot area.
