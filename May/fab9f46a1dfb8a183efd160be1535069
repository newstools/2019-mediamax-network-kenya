Khartoum, Tuesday Sudan’s military rulers said  Tuesday that six  members of security forces were killed during protests, as tensions mounted over makeup of a new joint civilian-military council. Demonstrators reinforced their barricades outside the army headquarters in Khartoum after the two sides differed in talks Monday on the number of council seats for civilians and military representatives. The joint body is supposed to replace the military council that took power after the army ousted veteran president Omar al-Bashir on April 11 in the face of mass protests against his three-decade rule. But the two sides are at odds over its composition, with the military pushing for a 10-member council including seven military representatives and three civilians. Risking the anger of demonstrators, a top Sudanese general announced Tuesday that the new body would be headed by current military ruler General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Protesters have called the military council headed by Burhan “a copy cat of the toppled regime”. They want a majority of civilians on a 15-member joint council along with seven military representatives. Adding to the deepening discord, the  military council said that six security personnel were killed in clashes with protesters across the country on Monday. -AFP
