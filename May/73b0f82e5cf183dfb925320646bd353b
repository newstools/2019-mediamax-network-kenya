Reuters The African Union said on Tuesday that Sudan’s military rulers should hand over power to a civilian-led transitional authority within 60 days. In a statement, the AU said it noted “with deep regret” that the military had not stepped aside and handed power to civilians within a 15-day period set by the AU last month. The 60 days were a final extension for Sudan’s Transitional Military Council to hand over power to civilians, the AU said. The AU’s Peace and Security Council said it “reiterates its conviction that a military-led transition in the Sudan will be totally unacceptable and contrary to the will and legitimate aspirations, to democratic institutions and processes, as well as respect for human rights and freedoms of the Sudanese people,” The military leaders have been holding discussions with protest leaders and opposition figures on how to manage the transition to democratic rule.
