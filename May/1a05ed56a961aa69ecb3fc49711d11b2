Simon Nthusi @PeopleDailyKe Some Makueni MCAs exchanged blows on Tuesday following differences over  remarks by area Woman Rep Rose Museo citing discrimination against nominated leaders. Trouble started when Kasikeu MCA Julius Tangai hit at Museo for questioning why nominated MCAs were kicked out of a retreats over the weekend and warned her to stop interfering with County Assembly  affairs. In response, Nominated MCA Urbanus Wambua defended Museo saying she had a right to comment on county issues. This angered Tangai who reportedly descended on Wambua with blows joined by other MCAs bringing the  session to a close. Makueni Speaker Douglas Mbilu, however, denied that the MCAs had fought.
