MOGADISHU, Kenyan troops serving under the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) on Thursday carried out medical checks for residents of Dhobley in southern Somalia as part of efforts to improve relations with the locals. John Mnjalla, commandant of AMISOM Level II Hospital in Dhobley who led the team of military medics providing free health services to the community, said AMISOM “will do its best to bring relief to communities. We had a high turn up, and we recorded over 200 patients.” The contingent also handed over a consignment of drugs and medical consumables to the management of the Dhobley General Hospital, according to a statement from the AU mission issued on Friday. Siyad Mohamed Hassan, Dhobley’s administrator, requested AMISOM to extend health services to the people amid high disease burden and unfilled need for public health services. Hassan cited the need to provide specialized inpatient services such as surgery, treatment of diseases like cancer, bone ailments and maternal health services. “The community needs every form of health assistance. The need remains, and we request AMISOM to assist in whatever way,” he added. (Xinhua)
