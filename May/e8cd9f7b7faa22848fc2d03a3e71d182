Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Excessive regulation of the formal alcoholic beverages sector is pushing up consumption and production of illicit brews, a study by the Institute of Policy Analysis shows. According to the studies, the current regulation is what drives illicit alcoholic beverages and contrabands in the country. The institute’s chief executive Kwame Owino says alcohol policies should consist of a mixed approach involving problems directed policies and direct intervention. Owino says no single approach can clearly provide solutions to the problems facing Kenya as far as alcohol is concerned.  “There is need for Kenya to develop a comprehensive policy to fight illicit alcohol,” said Owino. Excessive drinking He says Kenya’s Alcohol Regulation Policy as contained in the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act (2010) harms all consumers. Alcoholism, he says, cannot be solved by the instruments in the policies. “Research analysis indicates that the approach taken to regulate alcohol is population-based rather than targeted at reducing excessive drinking,” said Owino. He says by limiting drinking hours and reducing alcohol advertisements in the media, policymakers assume that the move solves alcoholism which is not the case. “But that does not work, instead more people are pushed towards illicit alcohol. Our licensing model, while not effective at solving alcoholism, actually creates barriers to market entry,” said Owino. He says that a regulation model that involves direct interventions targeting individual drinkers and others aimed at specific alcohol-related problems such as drunk-driving are less likely to affect the non-problem drinker.
