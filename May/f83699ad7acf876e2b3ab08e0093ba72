Flour prices will drop significantly as from next week following the release of two million 90-kilogrammes bags of maize by the government. Value chain players predict that if the maize is released by early next week, flour prices are likely to drop by about Sh10 to Sh110. Unga is currently retailing at between Sh117 and Sh122 for a 2-kg packet. Cushion consumers The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) has released two million bags of maize to cushion consumers against escalating food prices. “The prices for grades fit for human and animal consumption will be Sh2,300 and Sh1, 400 per 90 kg bag respectively, subject to availability of stock,” the NCPB said in a statement. A 90 kg bag of maize is retailing at Sh3,000 from Sh3, 400 last month in most of the markets. United Grain Millers Association chairman Peter Kuguru said if the maize is released by early next week, prices of flour are expected to drop by Sh10 per packet. Though currently some small-scale millers are almost closing down due to lack of maize to process flour. NCPB acting managing director Zakary Magara yesterday said that the released quantity is part of 3.5 million bags the government had agreed to release early this month to tame skyrocketing prices.
