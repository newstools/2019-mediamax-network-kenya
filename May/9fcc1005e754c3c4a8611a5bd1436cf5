Cape Town, Thursday South African lawmakers on Wednesday re-elected Cyril Ramaphosa as the nation’s president, two weeks after the ruling ANC party returned to power in legislative elections. Ramaphosa was “duly elected president of the Republic of South Africa,” chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng told parliament after Ramaphosa was the only name nominated by lawmakers in Cape Town. He will be inaugurated on Saturday. Racial inequality Its newly elected parliament was also sworn in, excluding Ramaphosa’s influential deputy David Mabuza, who put off taking up his seat to address accusations he had brought the ruling party into disrepute. South Africa’s chief justice started swearing in lawmakers in batches of 10 ahead of the election of parliament’s presiding officers and nominations for president. ANC easily won South Africa’s May 8 general election, but its vote share fell to a post-apartheid low, reflecting anger at corruption and racial inequality still entrenched a generation since the former liberation movement took power. Mabuza’s exclusion is a reminder of the scandals that have damaged the ANC’s popularity and brought down Ramaphosa’s predecessor Jacob Zuma, who was removed from power by the party last year and now faces prosecution for graft. Mabuza, the former premier of Mpumalanga, a coal-producing province, has struggled to shrug off allegations of corruption. A report by the ANC’s Integrity Commission suggested he had brought the party into disrepute. “The deputy president has indicated he would like to have an opportunity to address these allegations,” said Ramaphosa in an ANC statement. – Agencies
