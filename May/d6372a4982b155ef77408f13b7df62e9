Kakamega and Vihiga counties are paying for leased medical equipment that are yet to be delivered to the counties’ health facilities, while some were delivered only this year. A spot check in four key hospitals in Kakamega and Vihiga counties revealed that some of the equipment for which installment payment is being remitted are not available. Vihiga County Hospital is yet to receive MRI machines and equipment for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Dependency Unit (HDU). Kakamega County General Hospital does not have chemo beds and bio-safety equipment that are crucial in the cancer treatment unit. In disuse Interviews with medics in the facilities also reveal that some of the equipment, whose contract agreements and cost has come under scrutiny by the Council of Governors and the Senate, are in disuse for lack of qualified personnel to operate them. Kakamega Hospital administrator Titus Omumia confirmed the level-five facility has not received Chemo beds and other medical equipment for the new cancer treatment centre but declined to confirm whether cancer equipment was part of the deal. He admitted that lack experts to operate some of the equipment had rendered them idle, citing the theatre where the county is seeking a qualified anesthetist to assist the Cuban doctor at the hospital. Vihiga County Referral Hospital (VCRH) also a level-five facility, has yet to receive ICU and HDU equipment.  Medical superintendent Vitalis Juma said he was not aware whether ICU and HDU were part of the deal. The hospital, however, received equipment for cancer treatment, in particular chemotherapy. “A delivery of two chemo-beds and assorted equipment including biosafety cabinets was made early this year,” said Juma, noting  that  the hospital is yet to install the equipment.
