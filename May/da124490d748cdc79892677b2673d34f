Barry Silah @obel_barry Jackie Janmohamed (pictured) has made a comeback as Cricket Kenya (CK) Chairperson following elections on Saturday amidst murmurs from certain corridors. The polls that were overseen by Ministry of Sports also saw Harpal Sehmi elected the vice-chairperson, current Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) chairman Tom Tikolo as Development Director while former international Kennedy Obuya is the new treasurer. However there is already hue and cry as the polls were carried out reportedly without blessings from all three associate provinces Dissatisfied members allegedly put in complaint letters to the CK secretary alleging also that they were not given ample time to participate apart from the fact that some never agreed with the line-up. The elections were necessitated following a Sports Disputes Tribunal directive late last year so as to end months of fights that had put the sport in a spin. The then Minister of Sports Rashid Echesa set up an interim committee last April with an aim of bringing stability to the ship that was being rocked amid key official resignations due to Kenya’s demotion from ICC Division Two in December 2017. Reports suggest that the nominees went in unopposed thus some critics argue it was not a properly constituted exercise. However Sehmi who has retained the seat he held in the past three years told People Sport it was necessary to carry out the constitutional exercise otherwise the game would suffer further damage. “First off, I am convinced we did the right thing before we faced indictment from the International Cricket Commission. What some people do not understand is that we would lose out on funding and might be even banned from participating in events. Those of us who took part in the whole programme are happy so that the sport goes forward.” Janmohammed who is also the Africa Cricket Association (ACA) President is expected to steer the sport back on course given her networks within ICC.
