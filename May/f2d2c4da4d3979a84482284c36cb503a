Wheat farmers in lower Narok are staring at losses running into millions of shillings because of poor seed germination and poorly distributed rains. About 150,000 acres under the crop, according to a local farmers association, has been affected. It says most farmers in the region would from the end of next month harvest below 10 bags of grain weighing 90 kg each, down from 35 bags last year. The February-March rains which heralds the planting season came late when most farmers had already planted, forcing some to do it all over again because of uneven germination. Repay loans Farmers said yesterday that most of them would be unable to repay loans they borrowed from financial institutions, asking them to reschedule repayment. “Most farmers will harvest as low as even five bags per acre. The situation is so bad. Even if it rains now, little will be salvaged because harvesting will be starting before the end of next month,” said Erisha Kuluo, the secretary, Narok Wheat Farmers Association. He said if fall worms that have invaded maize farms in the North Rift descend on farms, the harvest would be low, adding that most farmers would not be able to be in business next year. “They will not be able to go back to farms because banks will not give them loans until they repay the current one. This is a sad situation,” he said. Kuluo lamented that compared to the previous years, production cost this year went up by 100 per cent because of absence of government subsidised farm inputs such as fertiliser. Fredrick Shikuku, the Narok South Agriculture Officer said compared to last year, harvests would be depressed because of poor rains, adding that long rains had failed. “The little rain which fell between mid last month and last week was not enough to save the situation. It came two months after planting had taken place,” he said.
