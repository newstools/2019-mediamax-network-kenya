Kiambu County Development Implementation Committee (CDICC) on Friday expressed shock after a Sh65 million National Irrigation Board project in Thika sub-county was vandalised. Pipes of Komo Irrigation Scheme development project that commenced in 2014 and was completed in 2016 were cut off as the vandals diverted water into their lands for irrigation. The destruction has denied people living downstream the valuable commodity. CDICC chair Wilson Wanyanga, who is also Kiambu County commissioner, decried the destruction and called on the community to embrace and take care of projects in their villages. “These projects are put up so they can help you to engage in social-economic activities and, therefore, improve your standards of living,” he said. During the tour by the CDICC, the project supervisor engineer Loise Kahiga said the major challenge experienced in the project was mining of quarry stones. “Land owners have leased their land for mining hence affecting a section of the distribution line,” she said. She added that the second phase of the project will expand irrigation schemes by putting an additional 275 acres under production to benefit 550 farmers. The irrigation project is in line with the President’s Big  Four agenda on food security.
