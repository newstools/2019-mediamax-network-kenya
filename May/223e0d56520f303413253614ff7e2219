Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Members of the National Police Service want the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to implement a report on police shootings targeting their colleagues and relatives. The officers said the report  is yet to be acted upon three years  down the line. Similar sentiments were echoed during a familiarisation tour by the IG at the General Service Unit headquarters in Ruaraka and the Recce Company training in Ruiru. The calls came hours after a KDF officer shot dead three relatives and turned the gun on himself in Eldoret. “Every time the IG meets police officers to know the challenges facing them, concerns on the implementation of inquiry report on police shootings feature prominently. This touches the very core of the police welfare,” a senior officer from IG’s office said. According to the report, alcoholism, marital disputes, improper control of firearms and inherent stress were cited as the major causes of fatal shootings by police officers targeting their colleagues and spouses. The report was handed over to Mutyambai’s predecessor, Joseph Boinnet in 2016 but until his exit last month, he was yet to act on it. The findings of the report titled “Causes of shootings by police officers targeting their colleagues’ paints a grim picture of senior commanders ability to handle the welfare of their juniors.
