Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Members of the National Assembly have suspended the implementation of a policy that seeks to limit the age of imported used cars in the country The parliamentary committee on Trade chaired by Kanini Kega (Kieni) yesterday declared the policy a roadside pronouncement that has no legal backing and thus ought to be suspended. The proposed National Automotive Policy seeks to reduce the age of imported second hand cars from the current eight years to five years before finally phasing off the imports Speaking when the committee met Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, Kega  was categorical that the car dealers are free to import the vehicles until the policy by the government goes through the public participation and approval by the House He said: “I want you to confirm to people out there that the status quo remains until the policy is approved because this matter has caused a lot of anxiety out there.” The sentiments by Kega came even as MPs present accused the ministry of coming up with a policy without following the due process. However, Munya while defending himself admitted that the proposal had not been subjected to public participation and approval by Parliament.
