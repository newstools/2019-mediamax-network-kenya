Gor Mahia forced their closest pursuers in the 2018/19 race Sofapaka into submission at Kisumu’s Moi Stadium yesterday to inch closer to an unprecedented 18th SportPesa Premier League crown. K’Ogalo won by second half goals from Samuel Onyango and Jacques Tuyisenge to open a 10-point buffer and could wrap the title on Wednesday in Mumias if they beat Nzoia Sugar. Sofapaka were no match to K’Ogalo and were restricted to just two shots on target in the entire game. Splendid finish A near total dominance in the first half was rewarded with early second half goals as Onyango profited from sleek interplay at Sofapaka goalmouth to beat Ndikumana from close range. Tuyisenge then eased Gor’s nerves with a splendid finish borne of a spectacular build up between him and Francis Kahata. At Bukhungu stadium, Allan Wanga converted a second half penalty to raise his tally to 18 goals as Kakamega Homeboyz beat Western Stima 2-0. In Kericho, Ulinzi Stars marksman Enosh Ochieng refused to surrender the golden boot chase as he scored late in the soldiers’ 2-1 loss to Zoo FC. Dan Chetambe shot the relegation threatened Zoo ahead from the spot 12 minutes after kick-off and Ernest Kipkoech doubled Zoo’s advantage six minutes to half-time. Ochieng then popped up with his 18th goal of the season two minutes to full time. Meanwhile, Mount Kenya United dished out a second walkover in three weeks when they failed to honour their tie against Mathare United at Kasarani stadium last evening. The cash-strapped club failed to convince their sulking players to honour the game hence losing their sixth point in such nature. In Awendo, AFC Leopards and Sony Sugar shared spoils with a barren draw as their rescheduled game finally kicked off while at Ruaraka, Amini Muzerwa scored in the 93rd minute to salvage a point for Tusker against Nzoia Sugar.
