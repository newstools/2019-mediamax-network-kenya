Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin Kenya Airways has reported a Sh7.6 billion loss for the year ended December 2018, continuing a stream of huge losses the airline has been reporting for the last five years. This comes as the national carrier adjusts to a January to December financial year reporting module from the previous March 31 year end, while blaming high operating costs for its continued losses. The airline had reported a Sh5.6 billion loss after tax for the year 2017. “The 2018 results are not directly comparable with the 2017 results as it is a representation of 12 months against the nine months in 2017.  Were the 2017 results to be annualised, there would have been improvement in the results for the year,” chairman Michael Joseph said yesterday. The losses, however, continue even as top managers at the airline draw millions in salaries and allowances, with an ongoing turnaround strategy bearing  fruit. Managers and consultants are said to take home up to Sh70.5 million monthly on salaries of between Sh1 million and Sh8 million. This is the fifth consecutive year the national carrier, known by its international code as KQ’s, continues to wallow in losses. The worst year was 2016 when it reported a Sh26.2 billion loss after falling deeper from Sh25.7 billion loss reported in 2015. Management has blamed fuel, personnel and the cost of aircraft for its troubles, which it says remain the top three drivers of airline costs, contributing to about two thirds of total operating costs.
