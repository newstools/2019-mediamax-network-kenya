Paul Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKe Kieni MP Kanini Kega is working on a draft amendment to the Judicial Service Commission Act that seeks to bar lawyers appointed to the commission from representing clients in courts of law. The lawmaker claims lawyers appointed to JSC intimidate magistrates and judges or get favourable rulings from them given the commission is their employer. Addressing journalists on Friday after officiating the opening of 12 classrooms at Mlima Kenya Primary School, built by US-based Wallis Annenberg Foundation, Kega (pictured) said he wants the lawyers prevented from active practice while they are members of JSC, citing conflict of interests. He said the war against corruption is failing at the judicial level and there is need to look for the root cause and rectify it. The MP said he is opening a discussion that Kenyans need to engage in and make deliberate efforts to clean up the commission to allow the fight against corruption to succeed. The school received a facelift from wooden classrooms to permanent ones and learners were educated on conservation.
