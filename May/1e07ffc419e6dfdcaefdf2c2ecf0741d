Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o now claims an incident early this week in which ODM leader Raila Odinga was heckled while on a development tour in Muhoroni was pre-planned. In a paid-up advert in local dailies yesterday, Nyong’o  apologised for the incident saying “a small band of engineered naysayers” hijacked the event for political mileage. But Kisumu Senator Fred Outa said Nyong’o was to blame for failing to conduct proper public awareness about the project before Raila’s visit. Raila’s delegation with Cabinet Secretaries Peter Munya (Trade), James Macharia (Transport) and John Munyes (Petroleum ) was met with hostilities at Ombeyi area in Muhoroni during the launch of proposed industrial park project.
