By Paul Muhoho The Judiciary will not condone delayed judgments to promote public confidence in the institution, Chief Justice David Maraga said Friday. He emphasised that all judges, magistrates and judicial officers must pull up their socks to eliminate case backlog and conclude matters expeditiously. Justice Maraga recalled that he promised to have 170,186 cases that were five years old cleared by December last year. By the end of March, this year, 154,184 cases had been concluded. “At the same time, 45,000 cases transited into the five-year band, meaning that about 1,667 cases were transiting five-year backlog every month,” he said. “This is an indication that the performance of the Judiciary in the dispensation of justice is improving consistently and soon we shall be seeing a situation where cases are resolved in real time,” Justice Maraga said when he launched the third cycle performance management and measurement evaluation report at the Supreme Court in Nairobi. “I appreciate the crucial role the judges, magistrates, judicial officers and staff are playing in the delivery of justice, sometimes under immense pressure and extremely difficult circumstances. They are not always appreciated for the excellent work that they do. But they must continue to selflessly serve our people and to deliver justice to all without fear or favour,” he said.
