Newly-promoted Football Kenya Federation Women’s Division One side Nakuru West Queens are dreaming of a second straight promotion. Nakuru’s optimism stems from the fact that they have won three straight matches since their promotion with last weekend’s 3-2 victory over title contenders Gusii Starlets the highlight. The team had an impressive run in Division Two last season, winning the title unbeaten, as they secured promotion to the second tier and coach Ben-Peters Esitoko believes they are capable of reaching the top flight. “Beating Gusii Starlets who are league regulars and one of the favourites gives us belief that even though we are new in the league, we have what it takes to challenge for promotion,” said Esitoko. In Sunday’s match, Stella Onyango was the star as she found the back of the net twice to give Nakuru a 2-0 lead 30 minutes into the game before a penalty from Lydia Mogere gave Gusii hope towards the end of the first half. After the break, Nakuru kept frustrating Gusii with textbook passes and their efforts yielded a third goal scored by Mellon Mulindi in the 50th minute. However, Gusii did not give up and kept probing until Mwanahamisi Ndege scored their second five minutes later. Nakuru then stood firm and protected their lead with goalkeeper Juliet Adhiambo playing a huge part as she made three one-on-one saves. It was Gusii’s first loss after starting the season with three straight wins but coach Lai Oyori remains unshaken. “We played well but suffered injuries in midfield. Our defence was also not up to standards but we are not giving up. We have two matches at home to wrap up the first leg and in the second leg we fight for the title,” said Oyori.
