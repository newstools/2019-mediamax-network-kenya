The government is set to phase out P1 teacher training so as to have graduate teachers, who are better equipped to deliver on the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC). Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said the P1 teacher trainees admitted this year will be the last lot, phasing out a system that has produced teachers even for neighbouring countries. Belio said beginning next year, all teacher trainees will be admitted to diploma programmes, saying the graduates will be able to implement the CBC. The PS spoke yesterday at the Kenya School of Government when he addressed experts designing the remaining stages of the curriculum. Belio said the new curriculum is underway with 27 million textbooks already supplied to all public primary schools. He added that 91,000 teachers were also trained during the school holidays to handle the new curriculum that phases out the 8-4-4 system, which has been in use since the 1980s. The PS said the new education system is meant to churn out graduates with the desired 21st century skills.  He called on teachers to be selfless during the implementation of the new curriculum, saying theirs is a noble calling to impart knowledge and transform lives.
