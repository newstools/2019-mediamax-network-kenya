Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Five people; two police officers, two security guards and a taxi driver, were yesterday charged with stealing from Barclays Bank ATMs. Fredrick Otiya, Daniel Okindo, George Njoroge and John Makambogo are accused of stealing Sh2.8 million at Barclays Bank ATM at Kenya Cinema Plaza along Moi Avenue in Nairobi. The fifth accused person, Patrick  Karanja, a taxi driver, was charged with stealing Sh1 million. According to the charge sheet, he allegedly committed the offence on April 20 at the Barclays Bank ATM located at Mater Hospital in Nairobi. The two police officers and two security guards faced another count of conspiracy to commit a felony of stealing Sh2,840,000 from Barclays Bank. The five, who appeared before Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi, denied the charges and were released on a cash bail of Sh500,000 each. The case will be heard on June 5. The Barclays Bank money heist which happened during  the Easter weekend  left the bank short of at least Sh11 million. According to police reports, the theft may have been planned as the four machines were either unmanned, tampered with or CCTV obstructed.
