Football Kenya Federation Women’s Premier League (WPL) club officials have resolved to stop honouring matches until their concerns are addressed. In a meeting held in Nakuru on Tuesday, 13 sides from the 16-team league, represented by their club officials, arrived at the decision after deliberations on what they term poor management of the league. The officials accuse the federation of short-changing the clubs on matters regarding sponsorship as they are yet to receive any money, 10 rounds into the 2019 season despite being promised that cash will be available a fortnight into the campaign. Financial constraints “It was a gentleman’s agreement that the FIFA grants will be available two weeks into the league and that we should commence the league. However, the money is yet to be availed and there has been no communication. The clubs have suffered enough and we cannot continue with the league as things stand,” said one of the officials. Last year, FKF offered all WPL clubs a grant of Sh750,000 each per season for logistics, the money coming off FIFA’s funds for women’s football development. “So far, Vihiga Leeds have been relegated for giving three walkovers. Others have two walkovers and most of this is due to financial constraints. The federation is aware of what most of these teams are going through but are not communicating,” another official said. The standoff, if not resolved before the weekend, will bring back memories of last season where the league took a three-month break before the second leg could kick off as clubs went on a go-slow over lack of funds. The federation blamed a late release of funds from FIFA then. No response FKF boss Nick Mwendwa promised to shed light on the issue but by the time of going to press, he was yet to respond. His deputy Doris Petra, who is in charge of women’s football, said she is bereaved and unaware of the development.
