A Nigerian student who was arrested last year and wrongly accused of drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia has returned home, two weeks after she was freed. Zainab Aliyu was reunited with her family at the Kano International Airport. Saudi authorities had accused her of smuggling 2,000 packs of Tramadol, a strong pain killer, in a bag. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency of Nigeria (NDLEA) later found that a criminal gang, operating at the Kano airport, had been planting illicit drugs in travellers’ luggage. Nigerian government then got involved to secure Zainab’s release, which had also received a lot of online support from Nigerians. Drug trafficking is a capital offence in Saudi Arabia, which practices conservative Islam. Those found guilty are executed. This was the fate earlier this month of a Nigerian woman, who was beheaded in the city of Mecca, along with two Pakistani men and a Yemeni man. -BBC
