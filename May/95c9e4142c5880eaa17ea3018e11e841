Daniel Muoki wants the court to order that an international audit firm be appointed to conduct an audit of the procurement process and financial transactions in relation to the sale, supply and maintenance of the equipment to county governments through the ministry of Health by five companies. Two hospitals The companies — Shenzen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics, Esteem Industries (India), Bellco srl (Italy), Phillips Medical Services and General Electric (USA) — have been named as interested parties in the suit. Under the lease signed in 2015, the Ministry of Health would equip at least two hospitals in every county and the facilities would be leased for seven years. As per the agreement, recurrent costs such as supply of consumables and reagent, maintenance and replacement of parts were to be covered at no additional cost to the facilities. Through lawyer Esther Andisi, the businessman, says the Ministry of Health continues to pay the companies for recurrent costs without being accountable to the taxpayer.
