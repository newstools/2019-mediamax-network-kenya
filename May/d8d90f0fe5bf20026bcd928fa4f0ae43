George Kebaso @Morarak Only journalists with valid press cards issued by the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) will be allowed to cover Parliament, courts and press conferences, the media regulator has announced in new measures to weed out quacks. Last evening, the council said it had come to its attention that the number of unaccredited journalists has risen alarmingly, and were involved in criminal acts. “The Media Council of Kenya has taken note of the high number of unaccredited journalists operating within the precincts of Parliament, courts of law and hotel facilities, who in addition to not complying with the Code of Conduct for the Practice of Journalism in Kenya – Contrary to Section 35(1) of the Act — are also said to be blackmailing legislators, litigants and hotel guests, while harassing bona fide journalists,” said MCK chief executive David Omwoyo in a statement.
