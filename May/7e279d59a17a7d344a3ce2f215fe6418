Mathew Ndung’u, Bonface Musangi and Salma Chilembi @PeopleDaily The government will not extend deadline for Huduma Namba registration, Central Regional Commissioner Wilson Nyagwanga has said. The administrator said the government has no budget earmarked for extension of the programme after May 17. Speaking when he inspected the ongoing registration at Mataara, Kamwangi and Gatukuyu villages in Gatundu North, Nyagwanga urged all to enlist in the National Integrated Identity Management System, which they will use to access government services.  “Kenyans should stop the attitude of rushing to comply with anything when deadlined has lapsed,” he said. More than 21 million Kenyans have so far registered nationally. Nyagwanga revealed only 2.3 million people in region less than 45 per cent, have so far registered against a target of over seven million. He directed chiefs and their assistants to educate residents on the importance of registration. Meanwhile, persons living with disability (PWD) in Coast region claim they have been sidelined in Huduma Namba registration . They said most registration centres are overcrowded, making it hard for them to register. Jemimah Kutata, a PWD rights champion, urged the government to put in place, measures to ensure persons with disability are registered. “There are no measures put in place to facilitate people living with disability. We fear we might be left out if we are left to fight for ourselves,” she said.
