With the eagerly-awaited AFC Leopards elections set to take place on June 23, candidates vying for the top seat have intensified their campaigns in an effort to appeal to the voters. Dan Shikanda, Boniface Ambani, Richard Ekhalie and Maurice Amahwa who are all interested in replacing outgoing chairman Dan Mule have been busy campaigning. Addressing delegates in Kakamega, Shikanda, who was a member of the ‘Rescue Team, that brought stability to the club said his vast experience in local football puts him in good stead to manage Ingwe. Key agenda “My vision is to see the team win the league title and also compete in CAF competitions. It’s sad that a giant like this has been reduced to fighting relegation,” said Shikanda. Amahwa, who lost to Mule in the last election, said: “I have a dream of transforming this club into a very competitive outfit in Kenya and beyond. With the sponsorship of SportPesa, we don’t see why the team is failing to motivate players.’’ For Ambani, who featured for Leopards in the 90s and currently serves as the youth coach, ending leadership wrangles is his key agenda. “I intend to establish a transparent NEC that will implement sound football policies and also bring financial transparency. We shall review our club scouting network that will enable us get the best players in the country,” said Ambani. Former Leopards CEO Ekhalie is hoping to use his close relationship with corporates and politicians to make the club financially sound.
