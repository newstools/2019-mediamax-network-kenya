Police in Mutomo area of Kitui county have arrested over 32 bar owners found selling illicit, second generation brews and operating bars without licences. Speaking yesterday during a sting operation to flush out rogue bar operators at Ikanga shopping centre, Mutomo Deputy County Commissioner Jacob Ouma said inhabitable buildings have been converted into bars hence risking the lives of revellers. “Today it is a rental house, tomorrow a bar; some of the premises housing bars are dingy and do not meet the public health standards to be operational. We are shutting down such outlets in a bid to protect the health of residents,” he said. The administrator lauded the public for waging a campaign to ensure the manufacture, sale and consumption of the killer brews is dealt with . “We have arrested 22 operators in Mutha, four in Mutomo and six in Ikanga trading centres. They have been operating without the required business and public health permits,” said Ouma. He said  no amount of intimidation from the manufacturers will slow down  government’s efforts in wiping out the illicit trade. -KNA
