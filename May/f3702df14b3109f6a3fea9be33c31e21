Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and seven others were yesterday released on a bond of Sh20 million or a Sh8 million cash bail each over a Sh68 million fraud case. Milimani chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti granted the bail terms on condition that all accused persons deposit their passports with the court while those who do not have travel documents must notify the Immigration director before making any travel plans. In his ruling, Ogoti said the charges facing the accused persons are serious and cautioned them against violating any of the bail terms. At the same time, Ogoti ordered that former Nairobi mayor and Embakasi Central parliamentary aspirant John Ndirangu be released on a Sh12 million bond or a cash bail of Sh5 milllion. Paul Mutunga, accountant Manasseh Karanja and the widow of deceased lawyer Stephen Kariuki, Hannah Muthoni, were released on Sh4 milllion cash bail or Sh10 milllion bond each. Kidero, his former Chief of Staff George Wainana and their co-accused were released after spending four nights in police cells following their arrest last Friday. During bail application on Monday,  the Director of Public Prosecutions, through Alexander Muteti, had opposed their plea to be released on bail, saying they are likely to interfere with witnesses, allegations the defence strongly refuted. An affidavit filed in court by the prosecution said the accused are former employees of Nairobi County government, sitting MPs and established businesspeople and are likely to tamper with the evidence. The court heard that “in total disregard of the duty imposed upon them by the Constitution and the People of Kenya, and against public interest, the accused persons embezzled and acquired the Sh58 million for personal gain leading to the loss of public monies”. The court yesterday ordered the DPP and the EACC to supply the accused with all evidence material within 14 days. Pretrial will start on June 4.
