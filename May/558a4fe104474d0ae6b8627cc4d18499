People Daily Team @PeoopleDailyKe Yesterday’s Labour Day celebrations across the country were characterised by low turn-out, with most workers giving the annual event a wide berth. In Kakamega, the home of  county of Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, the event was cancelled at the last minute over an alleged  financial hitch. Cotu branch officials said they could not  proceed with preparations at the Bukhungu Stadium. “We have not received any money and…there has been no communication from Cotu headquarters on the matter. I plan to attend the celebration in Kisumu,” said Caleb Jumba, Kenya Building Construction Timber and Furniture Industries Employees Union western region secretary. In Mombasa, organisers decried the low turnout by both residents and local political leaders. MPs from the county snubbed the event while Governor Hassan Joho sent two CECs Seth Odongo and Hezel Koitaba to represent him. “It’s so disappointing that despite inviting them (politicians), they did not attend. They are nowhere to be seen because it’s not a campaign season,” said Cotu Coast regional secretary Gideon Mutiso. Nothing to celebrate He warned that six companies risk closure for failing to honour employment agreements with their employees. Some residents who spoke to People Daily said workers had nothing to celebrate, given the high cost of living.  “We hear that the economy of the country is growing, but we cannot feel it,” said Martin Munene, a vendor based in Tononoka area. A similar low turnout was witnessed in Nyeri, Nakuru, Eldoret, Bungoma, Meru and Embu, Kisumu  and Kisii.  In Kisii, area County Commissioner Godfrey Kigochi  urged trade unionists to support the fight against graft. Reporting by Harrison Kivisu, Robert Ochoro, Yusuf Masibo and Noven Owiti
