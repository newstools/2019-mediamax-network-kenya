by Seth Onyango @PeopleDailyKe Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi (pictured) risks losing his seat after the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu expunged his membership from the Amani national Congress (ANC) register. ANC had asked the registrar to delist Osotsi citing gross misconduct and contravention of party constitution. In a statement to newsrooms, Nderitu confirmed the MP’s name has been removed from the party register. “The name of Godfrey Atieno Osotsi has been removed from the party membership register of ANC as decided by your party,” she said in a statement. Osotsi’s association with opposition leader Raila Odinga and rebellion to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been seen as the source of his woes. Last month, the MP suffered a blow after the High Court ruled in favour of ANC after he was replaced as Secretary General with Barrack Muluka.
