Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Only 34 out of the 47 counties will benefit from the Sh5.76 billion Equalisation Fund for the 2019/20 financial year. The new list contains 20 additional counties which were not in the initial list which were considered disadvantaged and therefore qualified for extra financing through the fund. During the 2018/19 budget, a total of Sh8.5 billion was budgeted for the Equalisation Fund. According to the Constitution 2010, under Article 204, the equalisation fund was established to address historical marginalisation and unequal development across Kenya. Turkana will receive the lion’s share of Sh626.62 while Murang’a will receive the least share of the fund. According to the Equalization and Appropriation Bill 2019, 11 counties will share Sh3.73 billion or 64 per cent. According to the Bill, West Pokot will receive the second highest allocation at Sh559.57 million, Narok (Sh422.64 million), Mandera (Sh412.63 million) while Wajir will receive Sh399.9 million. Other counties set to receive the funds include Baringo which will pocket Sh325.9 million, Kilifi (Sh295.7 million), Tana River (Sh242.15 million), Kajiado (Sh227.17 million) and Kitui’s Sh217.67 million. Basic services Counties which will receive less than Sh10 million share from the kitty include Murang’a at Sh3.1 million, Nakuru at Sh3.5 million, Trans Nzoia (Sh4.09 million), Machakos (Sh7.07 million), Taita Taveta (Sh7.3 million) and Busia’s Sh9.85 million. “The fund granted under Section Two shall be deemed to have been appropriated as from July 1, 2019, for basic services under article 204 (1) of the Constitution as further provided for in the Public Finance Management Act and Equalization Fund Guidelines 2015,” the bill says in part. According to the Constitution, the fund should be used by the government “only to provide basic services including water, roads, health facilities and electricity to marginalised areas to the extent necessary to bring the quality of those services in those areas to the level generally enjoyed by the rest of the nation.” The fund is supposed to receive 0.5 per cent of all the revenue collected by the Treasury each year as approved by the National Assembly.
