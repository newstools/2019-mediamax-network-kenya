Meanwhile, Raila has cautioned Kenyans against ethnicity, which he claimed could water down gains since Independence. The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)leader regretted that negative ethnicity will erode the democratic gains that Kenyans secured at the dawn of independence after they chased away colonialists. “Unless we move out of ethnic doldrums, the country will never move forward. We must as leaders retrace our steps and devise new ways to reunite Kenyans,” he said. He said ethnicity has infiltrated every sector of development in the country but assured they will use the Building Bridges Initiative to deal with it. “Kenyans should be wary of those who thrive on ethnicity to divide  them for selfish gains,” he said adding that ethnicity is the biggest enemy in Kenya followed by corruption and discrimination in terms of resource allocation.
