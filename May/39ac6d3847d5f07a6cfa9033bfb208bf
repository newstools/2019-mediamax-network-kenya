Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) wants commercial banks to undertake stringent measures that will not only safeguard institutions and their customers from being swindled by fraudsters, but also deter scammers from stealing their identities. Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else’s name and personal information in order to gain financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person’s name. Kenya had an estimated 42.2 million active internet users as of September 2018 compared to 41.1 million in the same period in 2017, the latest Communications Authority of Kenya indicates. SIM swap Across the world, fraudsters are coming up with various ways of defrauding consumers. According to studies done by Kaspersky Lab research, mobile payments and the banking system are suffering a wave of attack – mostly powered by SIM swap fraud. SIM swap fraud is committed when a criminal switches your phone number over to a new SIM card. In some cases, these are employees working together with criminals. This is used to not only steal credentials and capture one-time passwords sent via an SMS, but also to cause financial damage to victims, resetting their financial services accounts and allowing the fraudsters to access to currency accounts not only in banks but also in fintechs and credit unions. “Fraudsters are also using it as a way to steal money using WhatsApp, loading the messages in a new phone, contacting the victim’s contacts asking for money and simulating an emergency situation,” the studies indicate. Recently, Barclays Bank of Kenya ATMs were emptied by fraudsters’, an attempt which fintech experts attribute to insiders who work in cahoots with crooks. In 2017, the Kenya Revenue Authority system was allegedly attacked and a huge amount of cash reported lost. In the same year, Kenya Cybersecurity reported that the country lost Sh21.1 billion to cybercrime. Staff vetting Speaking while launching the Kaa Chonjo programme aimed at sensitising the public about the dangers posed by fraudsters in the financial sector, CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said the best way to stem the tide is for banks to vet their staff and also ensure that individuals who hold crucial information such as passwords are regularly monitored. The governor said banks need to also scrutinise firms they outsource to provide critical services to promote efficiency because some of these firms may not be aware of the controls and policies that the banks have. “Institutions need to audit the service provider to ensure that they adhere to the cyber standards. It’s imperative for the banks to review their outsourcing arrangements to ensure that cybersecurity measures are in place to safeguard them,” said Njoroge. Njoroge said there is also need for banks to ensure that third party service providers adhere to set cybersecurity standards and subject them to heightened due diligence to avoid the planting of the backdoor systems used to infiltrate the internal system.stands laughed lamely, and umpteen speedy cats cleverly sacrificed one irascible elephant.
