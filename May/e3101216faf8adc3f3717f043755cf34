National Treasury yesterday disclosed that 22 out of 47 county governments failed to submit budget execution annexes in the last financial year 2017/2018 against requirements. This comes as Auditor General’s office claims to have gone through all county governments reports submitted to the Senate. The revelation only compounds queries during a national audit trail which recently put county bosses on the spot after Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee singled out Sh2.1 billion which Kiambu county allegedly spent on national government functions. Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee report indicated that the country spent the cash to coordinate State House functions, South Sudan Peace process, free primary education and pay retired Presidents. Further reports from the office of the Auditor General showed that apart from Kiambu, other counties including Kakamega, Kitui Nyeri and Kirinyaga also spent huge amounts of money on functions they lacked jurisdiction. The Senate queried anomalies in the annex summarising expenditure by programmes and sub-programmes, which were, however, not captured in the 2017/2018 annual and supplementary budgets in Controller of Budget reports. “It has since been noted that some county governments generated reports with national government descriptions and submitted for audit without adequate review to confirm whether the programmes and sub-programmes related to their entities,” Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich said in a statement.
