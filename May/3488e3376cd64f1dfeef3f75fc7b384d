The body of Ann Kanario, a Business Administration  Fourth Year student, was recovered on Monday  alongside that of her lover, a student at Chuka University, in a rented house near the campus.

Elsewhere, a 21-year-old boy hacked to death  his  Form Two girlfriend in Misewani sub-location, Kitui Central. Area Chief Peter Ndambo said the girl hails from Meru county and was a student in a school in the area. He said the boy’s mother recently learnt that the girl was a student and left her to continue with learning instead of getting married to her son. Ndambo, however said, the girl later returned to visit the boy but  on Tuesday night, he hit her with a machete on the head killing her on the spot. Kitui Central OCPD Sicily Gatiti said the suspect is in custody and will be arraigned after investigations are complete.
