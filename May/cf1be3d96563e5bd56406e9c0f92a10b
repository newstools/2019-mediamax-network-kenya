Brussels, Wednesday @PeopleSport11 On July 15, 2017 in Ninove, central Belgium, three women stood on the podium after the 800m race at a local track and field event. Two were flashing smiles but one, running for Ukraine as Galina Sychko, looked bashful and aloof. Was she shy, nervous, or just uncomfortable in the spotlight? All of the above and more, apparently. Multiple sources subsequently revealed an astonishing story of identity theft and fraud. It begins in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea, then part of Ukraine, and home to Kseniya Savina, a promising track athlete. Savina, who grew up in Simferopol, took on Russian nationality following Crimea’s annexation and began to compete for her adopted country. But disaster struck a year later when Russia was banned from international competition owing to revelations of massive state-backed doping. At 26, Savina’s career appeared to be finished, until she took matters into her own hands. Under an assumed identity and another nationality Savina competed abroad frequently over the ensuing three years. She borrowed the name and nationality of childhood friend Galina Syshko, a one-time 800m runner who also happened to look like her, though two years younger. Syshko might have had the looks, but she never had Savina’s talent, according to the Russian magazine Match which first revealed the fraud. Syshko recorded a modest 2:17sec over 800m as a young runner, then disappeared without trace from athletics for five years, before emerging in July 2016 with an impressive time of 2min 04sec. That improvement coincides with the identity switch which saw Savina competing in events in Belgium, France and elsewhere under her assumed name. The real Syshko stayed in Simferopol, working as a sports coach at a local school, where Savina’s husband Alexei Savin also worked.  – AFP
