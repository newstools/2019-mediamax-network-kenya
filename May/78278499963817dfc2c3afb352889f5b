Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The confession by Peter Ngugi, one of the accused in lawyer Willie Kimani murder case, that details where and how the murders were committed will be admitted in court. Justice Jessie Lessit allowed the prosecution to use Ngugi’s confession as part of evidence in the murder case of lawyer Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri saying it was taken in accordance with the evidence rules and was, therefore, admissible. “The statement of the accused was taken in accordance with the Evidence Rules and was, therefore, admissible under section 26 of the Evidence Act,” the judge ruled. Ngugi, a police informer, is charged with four police officers Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku and Leonard Mwangi with the murder of the three. He wanted the court to stop the prosecution from using the confession statement, saying he had been tortured, coerced and induced to make  the confession. Lessit, however, dismissed his claims saying the police followed the laid down procedure when they recorded the confession.
