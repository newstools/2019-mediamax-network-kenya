Political interference led to the cancellation of a prayer rally which was to take place last Saturday in Murang’a, organisers said yesterday. Bishop Stephen Maina of Full Time Winners Gospel Church, who was the chair of the clergy organising the rally, said political leaders took over the planning creating a totally different impression. He said the initial plan was to hold an interdenominational prayer rally and at the same time launch their Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (Sacco). “Some leaders took advantage of the rally to create a platform which they would use to drive their agenda. Our plans were totally different with theirs and this created a lot of confusion as whether this was a political or prayer rally,” he added. Maina refuted claims that the rally was being organised to install Deputy President William Ruto as the Central region political kingpin. Negative perception Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege said the idea of a prayer rally was hatched in July last year when the clergy met Deputy President William Ruto at his residence in Karen, Nairobi. She said a date was set for February but was pushed to April. The set date coincided with the burial of Jonathan Moi, the son of retired President Moi leading to the cancellation of the rally, again. Chege, however, said a  negative perception about the rally was created accusing some leaders from the region of interference adding that divisions among the members of Jubilee Party have led to ugly scenes in the recent past saying that this has to end. “We have Team Tanga Tanga and Team Kieleweke under  the Jubilee Party and this is a clear indication that things are not alright in the ruling party. Leaders should stop playing petty politics because they are causing divisions in the party,” she said. She however said the leaders from the region still have their support for Uhuru and his deputy adding that the two top leaders should work together and put their house in order.
