Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin Banking on the expected increase in demand for projects in the housing sector, local manufacturers are planning mass production ahead of the government’s rollout of housing projects under the Big Four agenda. Local firm, 64Door Factory, which specialises in interior wooden doors has positioned itself with a Sh240 million production facility in Nairobi which was launched in February. The management says it is ready to produce more than 50,000 doors annually which can feed the “affordable housing” segment of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four, encompassed to boost growth of the manufacturing sector to 15 per cent of GDP by 2022. The plant located in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, behind Sameer Business Park, is among the facilities which will see such projects serviced by locals. Director Nyamu Wanyoike said the firm has a product targeted for affordable mass housing market. Door manufacturer “We are a specialised door manufacturer, unlike most other manufacturers who do furniture in general, our attention is not divided. We are ready for the project and we believe it will give us an opportunity to utilise the capacity that we have,” he told Business Hub in an interview. Officially, production at the company’s factory started in quarter four of last year, Wanyoike said, with huge deliveries already made to a number of large construction projects in Nairobi. Its modern technology approach allows the firm to deliver and fix a single door in 20 minutes, he added. “Where 64Door comes in is that we have a production line that allows us to do big volumes and enjoy economies of scale which enables us to bring the unit cost down and to provide a standardised product,” said Wanyoike. The firm has plans to open showrooms in Nairobi starting with Westlands area before expanding to other major towns in the country. However, Wanyoike said deliveries can be done to any part of the country.
