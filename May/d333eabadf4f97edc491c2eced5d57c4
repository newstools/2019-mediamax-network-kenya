Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba yesterday led 25 diplomats in an indigenous tree planting exercise at Uplands forest in Lari, Kiambu county. The diplomats planted almost 3,000 trees with the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps Beyene Russom hailing Kenya for making a laudable step towards increasing forest cover. The Eritrean envoy, who spoke on behalf of all the diplomats, said the world must remain steadfast so as to conserve the environment. “The precedent set by Kenya will embolden other States and we must remain steadfast to sufficiently address climate change,” he said. Namwaba, who represented Cabinet secretary Monica Juma, said the country expects to achieve 10 per cent forest cover by 2030, and urged government ministries to adopt forests. He said  Kenya should be an environmental role model because it hosts the United Nations Environmental Programme headquarters.
