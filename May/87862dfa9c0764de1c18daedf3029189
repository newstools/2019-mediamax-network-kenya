The legislator was on his way to Molo when his vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser,  was hit from the back by another vehicle along Uhuru Highway, Nairobi, in the morning. Kuria was rushed to MP Shah Hospital where he underwent a medical check-up. He later posted on his Facebook page thanking God for surviving the accident, that left his vehicle completely destroyed. “God saves. And He saved me. He has saved us. This morning on my way to Molo we got involved in a road accident. Someone hit us from the back and sped off,” Kuria posted, adding that his driver and security officers were also unhurt. The motorist who hit the MP’s vehicle sped off after the accident with his vehicle partly damaged.
