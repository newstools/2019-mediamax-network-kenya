Kisii County Labour officer Kephas Odhiambo has decried rampant exploitation of residents seeking jobs by brokers. Odhiambo said the brokers were demanding bribes to seek jobs for residents in supermarkets and hardwares in the region, and were negotiating salaries on their behalf. Speaking to People Daily in his office, he said: “ The employees are underpaid and cannot afford to pay taxes, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and National Hospital Insurance Fund ( NHIF).” He said Labour officers would  visit supermarkets,  hardwares and security firms to assess terms and conditions of employees, and push for their improved welfare. “Some security firms are not registered. They pay their workers at night and intimidate them. We will enhance efforts to address that,” he said. The officer said 90 per cent of labour in the county was outsourced, adding that some workers, especially part time lecturers at universities, had worked for up to three years without salaries. A survey by People Daily at some supermarkets revealed that the workers were paid between Sh6,000 and Sh7,000 and worked all week. They workers said they are not allowed to join trade unions and those who dared to do so are sacked without notice. They added that those who fall sick for two to three days are fired them without notice.
