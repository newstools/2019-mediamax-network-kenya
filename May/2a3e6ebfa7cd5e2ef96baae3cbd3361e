Seth Onyango @SethManex More State corporations may soon be scrapped or merged to streamline operations. A taskforce has been formed to look into areas of overlaps and duplications and make recommendations to the public Service Commission (PSC). PSC chair Stephen Kirogo said the nine-member taskforce will  also review the mandate and relevance of State enterprises. “We recognise that the sector, when well tapped, can accelerate development by expanding the size of the economy and creating employment opportunities,” he said during the launch of the taskforce yesterday. Members of the taskforce include Jane Chege (chairperson) and members Wanjiku Wakogi, Philip Nyinyi and Vincent Nyangilo. Others are Simon Indimuli, Kennedy Ondieki, Jacqueline Manani, William Migwi and Maina Weru. The taskforce will also review the terms for chairpersons, chief executive officers, chancellors and vice chancellors of public universities, board members, management and unionisable staff of State corporations.
