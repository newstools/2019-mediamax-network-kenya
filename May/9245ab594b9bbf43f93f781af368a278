Promoted Western Bulls ‘Echulusi’ and Kisumu RFC lock horns in today’s KRU Championship final at the Bulls’ Ring in Kakamega as they battle for 2018/2019 title. Bulls’ coach Bram Shikanda said he will keep faith in the squad and tactics that worked for them against Kisumu in the league regular season; drawing 10-10 in Kisumu in the first leg before losing narrowly (9-8) in the return leg in Kakamega. “In the return leg, two of our tries were disallowed that should have made it a comfortable 18-9 win against them (Kisumu) but that is now water under the bridge. It is a final match of the season and most of my young squad members have never played at this stage and are excited to be on the big stage. From my end I will stick to what has worked for us entire season especially against them (Kisumu) as I hope to overturn the last minute loss in our last match,” Shikanda said. The feeling of earning promotion back to Kenya Cup has ignited morale in the team and coach Shikanda is upbeat, the mood in the camp will be fire enough to propel them to victory. “The morale in camp is so high, the boys are excited especially for the chance to play in the finals. I believe they should turn the morale into a win and ultimately lift the trophy,” said coach Shikanda. Players to watch in this match will definitely be free-scoring Derrick Ashiundu from Western Bulls and Israel Makokha (Kisumu), who have been pumping in points at will. Ashiundu has scored in almost every match Bulls played this season and was on target last weekend, scoring one of the three tries that helped beat USIU-Africa 22-16 and will be highly counted on in tomorrow’s match to help Bulls to title glory while Makokha who didn’t score last weekend against Catholic Monks will be keen to find the scoring boots to guide Kisumu past ‘Echulusi’.
