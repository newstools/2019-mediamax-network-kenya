Three of the companies are tanneries, while two are textiles and apparel manufacturers. The authority is pursuing directors of the companies for arrest. Toxic chemicals Nema Environment Inspector in charge of Compliance and Environment, Samuel Ngaanga confirmed to People Daily that the toxic chemical flowing into the open outside Tropical Heat main gate near Lunga Lunga estate is mainly from the Africa Apparels EPZ Limited. “The companies have been notified for many years. The Africa Apparels EPZ Limited particularly, have been promising to comply but have not done anything. We have, therefore, served closure orders to five companies to stop any activities until they comply,” he said during an inspection tour last Friday.
