George Kebaso @Morarak Driving schools have only one week to re-validate their operating licences or risk closure. Yesterday, the National Police Service (NPS) said it would enforce the order issued by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) last week, if the institutions will not have met the set requirements. “Police will enforce a countrywide crackdown on those who won’t have complied once the NTSA order expires,” Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai said, through his principal deputy Julius Kanampiu, at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) during the launch of the United Nations Road Safety Week that is being marked globally between May 6  and 12. This year’s theme is “Leadership for Road Safety”. Mutyambai said the orders apply to all motorists bound by the respective national road safety regulations as captured on the NTSA website. NTSA director general Francis Meja said the authority and NPS will constitute a team that will enforce the order. “There are slightly over 600 driving schools in the country. Each of these schools must adhere to the order to re-validate their licences. The move is aimed at weeding out driving schools operating without meeting the set requirements,” he said yesterday. He said NTSA has advised operators of driving schools to fill a re-validation form that can be found on its website and submit it to any of its offices within 14 days, beginning April 30.  In a published advertisement last week, NTSA said all driving schools will be held responsible for misinformation.
