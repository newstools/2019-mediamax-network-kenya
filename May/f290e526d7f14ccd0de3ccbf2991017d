DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Three county governments and the World Bank have agreed on a Sh10 billion Development Response to Displacement Impacts project. Garissa, Wajir and Turkana counties are  set to benefit from the initiative, which is aimed at improving access to water, healthcare, education and building resilience of communities in northern Kenya. The project is part of the World Bank’s Sh120-billion North and North Eastern Development Initiative and also covers Marsabit, Samburu, Mandera, West Pokot, Lamu, Tana River and Isiolo. Leaders from the three counties on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding, witnessed by Deputy President Willian Ruto, that will fast-track implementation of the projects. “The projects are meant to reduce the impacts caused by long-standing presence of refugees. I am glad we have agreed on the way forward whereby the projects will be implemented through community-driven development approach,” said Ruto. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok said the programme will go a long way in helping the host communities and urged implementation committees to do diligent work.
