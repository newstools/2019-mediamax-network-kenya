Relatives of eight dead people whose bodies were exhumed by a Chinese contractor at a graveyard in Kiteta, Kitui South are planning to perform cleansing rituals. Musango Mulatya, a resident, said the company went against African norms by exhuming skeletons from the graveyard despite having been warned by locals that the area was a graveyard. Speaking on Thursday at the graveyard, Mulatya, 75, said a tycoon, believed to be a former State House employee, sold the disputed land to the Chinese company that is constructing the Kibwezi-Kitui road to excavate murrum. Residents say they have witnessed digging up of human skulls and bones and rotten wooden coffins. “They exhumed bodies and transported them to the road without their knowledge. As they spread the murrum on the road, they stumbled upon body parts. They returned the bodies to the site and buried them,” said Rose Mutua, a villager. The disputed land has been a matter of discussion in stormy Land Adjudication Committee sittings in Mutomo over the years. The land dispute affects over 40 households that have lived in the area for decades. According to 80-year-old Zakayo Kimilu, the disputed land was their inheritance and they had set aside a section for a graveyard. He said traditional rites have to be performed to cleanse the land. “This is a disgrace and disrespect of the highest order of the dead,” said Sister Francisca Mulatya, a relative of one of the dead. They accused the tycoon of grabbing the land, including the graveyard belonging to the family of late Mutuku Mutunga which accommodated eight graves and which has partly been destroyed by the contractor.
