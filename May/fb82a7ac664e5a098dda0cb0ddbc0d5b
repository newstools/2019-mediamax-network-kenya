Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) is set to receive a cash boost from government  following a promise by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed yesterday. Amina, who paid a courtesy call on KRU officials and a section of players from all the teams at RFUEA grounds yesterday said in three days’ time, KRU’s coffers will be boosted with money from the Sports Fund to help them address some of their challenges in what will be a busy season where both the Sevens and Lionesses teams will be preparing for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic qualifiers in Johannesburg, South Africa. Pledge support “The teams have so many challenges but we have started to break down some of them so that moving forward, these issues become a thing of the past. We pledge our support and promise to walk this journey with all of you so that your expectations can be realised,” said Amina. She added: “The objective is for the team to achieve their potential without challenges. There are no challenges in the ministry or the treasury. Within three days, the resources will be made available to address the urgent needs and in return our expectations will be very high.” For Shujaa head coach Paul Murunga, the money cannot come early enough. “The players are dedicated. Some even have to stop or postpone semesters in school because of fees and they need allowances and salaries to support them and their families. The season takes a toll on them to a point that most cannot do any other job. This is a crucial time but we are dedicated to get maximum points to remain a core team status and qualify for the Olympics,” said Murunga, whose team still has the London and Paris legs to save their season. Maximum points Captain Jacob Ojee believes Shujaa, placed 13th on the 20-team log with 26 points, have what it takes to avoid relegation. “We have had a lot of challenges but the junior players who were brought in took up the mantle and now we target maximum points to make sure we remain in the circuit next season,” said Ojee.
