Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Strathmore University Gladiators are struggling to come to terms with their current position in the Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League where they are bottom of the 10-table with just one point from five matches. For a club that has won three Premier League titles in the last 10 years, this is a new low that has left long-serving coach Meshak Senge scratching his head for answers. Things took a turn for the worse last weekend when Strathmore were handed a 7-0 thrashing by defending champions Butali Warriors, a result that sees the latter move top of the standings with nine points from three matches. “Our confident levels are at an all-time low. That is the immediate issue we have to address within the camp,” said Senge, who led the team to league titles in 2009, 2010 and 2016 and is also the men’s national team coach. Braces from Francis Kariuki and George Mutira and a goal each from Moses Ademba, Constance Wakhura and Calvins Kanu completed the rout with Senge’s pain made worse by the fact that 15 of Butali’s players passed through his hands. “Only Amos Barkibir is not my former player but we have lost players before. However, not a single season did we find ourselves in a dire situation like this one,” said Senge, whose side take on fourth-placed Greensharks in their next march. There was another statement win at the weekend when 2017 champions Kenya Police staged an incredible comeback to hand Western Jaguars their first defeat of the season. Police recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win 5-3 at the Eregi TTC in Kakamega and now lie sixth on the table with four points from three matches.
