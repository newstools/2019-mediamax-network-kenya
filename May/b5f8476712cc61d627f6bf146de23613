The undying spirit at Sofapaka best depicts the phrase ‘hope springs eternal’.  Seven points shy of leaders Gor Mahia with just five games to go, Sofapaka have refused to throw in the towel, clinging to the hope that K’Ogalo will drop points. Sofapaka coach John Baraza can equally be equated to some miracle worker going by the depths from which he dug the team after succeeding Melis Medo. Baraza has tuned his team to the sharpest they can be under current circumstances and hope that slip ups like the one witnessed in the last minute of last weekend’s tie with Tusker will not recur. He faces a plucky Western Stima who halted a 13-game winless run with victory over basement boys Mount Kenya United before holding Gor to a barren draw. “I’m not giving up with the huge mathematical chance that we still have. Any team can slip up and going by their last game they (Gor)  can still drop points. We just need to be at our best and kill off games,” Baraza told People Sport yesterday.  Against Stima, Sofapaka face a team on a revival under new coach Salim Babu. “I inherited a team of talented players but with a bit of hard luck. We are working very hard to create our good luck and it showed in our past games but those are behind us and we must focus on the match ahead which is Sofapaka. We are not going to be push-overs as witnessed against Gor so our opponents must be at their best to compete,” said Babu. Baraza is counting on his 16-goal star Umaru Kasumba to push them to glory. K’Ogalo will be in Kisumu against Chemelil, looking to preserve their seven-point buffer ahead of next weekend’s top-of-the-table clash with Sofapaka. Coach Hassan Oktay has all players fit except Dennis Oliech who fractured his wrist against Stima. Elsewhere, AFC Leopards look to bounce back from their 2-0 humbling by Mathare United when they face relegation-threatened Zoo FC. Ingwe went on a nine-match unbeaten run until last weekend’s loss and take on a Zoo team who downed them in the first leg.
