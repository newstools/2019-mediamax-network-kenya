By Zachary Ochuodho Increased use of M-Pesa and mobile data contributed to Safaricom’s after-tax profit of Sh63.4 billion, which was a 14.7 per cent growth for the year ended March 30, 2019. Analysis of the firm’s profitability since 2013 reveals that the profit of the company, which is the most profitable business in Africa, has been growing at an average of Sh7.3 billion per year. According to the financial report, Safaricom’s total revenue increased by 7.1 per cent to Sh250.96 billion as revenue from voice, M-Pesa, mobile data and fixed service grew. Chief Executive Officer, Bob Collymore, said the telco continued to generate positive momentum at a time when the macro issues weighed in on customer choice. Due to the good performance, directors proposed the first and final dividend of Sh1.25 per share totalling Sh50.08 billion, which is 13.6 per cent higher than Sh44.07 billion paid last year to shareholders. However, SMS revenue dropped 1.3 per cent to Sh17.5 billion. Collymore said the board remains committed to investing in the business and continuing the firm’s strong record of paying progressive dividends each year. He said in 2020, the firm wants a capital budget of between Sh36 billion and Sh38 billion. Collymore said Kenyans have already borrowed Sh45 billion on Fuliza, a service that allows M-Pesa customers to complete their transactions when they have insufficient funds in their account. Safaricom board has proposed payment of a special dividend of Sh0.62 per share amounting to Sh24.84 billion. Collymore said they managed to realise the good performance by focusing on the customer, investing in the quality of its service, improvement of its network and creating differentiated customer experiences. “Our actions were guided by our purpose of transforming lives.  Our top priority for Financial Year 2019 was focusing on the customer and I am pleased to advise that we have witnessed improved customer sentiment, through brand consideration,” he said.
