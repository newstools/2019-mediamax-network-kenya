Irene Githinji and Felix Yegon @PeopleDailyKe Uncertainty shrouded an education sector meeting slated for today  after the ministry  said it was not aware of it. Education Cabinet secretary, George Magoha and Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) were allegedly expected to meet in an effort to deliberate the way forward on differences in opinion on various issues in the sector. Key among the issues the parties seek to discuss is the implementation of Competence Based Curriculum (CBC), which has time and again been vehemently opposed by the union. While Magoha has been firm that the CBC ‘train left the station’ in January and that there is no turning back, the union, led by secretary general Wilson Sossion, has continually chided the curriculum saying it is bound to fail. Another subject that was expected to feature in the meeting was interdiction of teachers. But yesterday, Magoha maintained a hard line stance that the said teachers will remain interdicted.
