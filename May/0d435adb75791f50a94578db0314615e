Ronald Mwadzombo @PeopleDailyKe Images of learners in Ganze constituency seated on concrete blocks inside a flooded classroom that were circulating on social media yesterday have once again exposed poor learning conditions in the area in Kilifi county. Kenyans on social media accused Governor Amason Kingi and area MP Teddy Mwambire of failing in their duties. Addressing the press, Mwangororo Primary School  PTA  chairman Justus Mwagona lamented over the poor state of the institution. He said the flooding has paralysed learning in three classes. Mwambire said on his WhatsApp and Facebook platform that 35 other schools in the area are in a similar state, and that he has not received the 2018/19 NG-CDF allocation for development “because of mistakes committed by my predecessor”.
