Harrison Kivisu and George Kebaso @Morarak The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has started a nationwide crackdown on unregistered pharmacies and practitioners selling drugs without licences as it seeks to cushion the public from harm. Board chairman Dr Jackson Kioko said it was shocking to establish that hundreds of pharmacies in the country operate illegally as they do not meet required standards. The agency has deployed inspectors in all counties to conduct the crackdown. On Monday, the board closed Get Well Pharmacy in Bamburi, Mombasa county bringing the number of closed drug dispensing shops operating illegally to 87 since July last year. During an inspection tour of the Coast region, Kioko accompanied by PPB chief executive Fred Siyoi said the facility had no valid licence. The board said in a statement that the closure confirms that a number of drug dispensing facilities in the country are operating illegally adding that it is closing in on most of the outlets. A report by the board indicates that within the same period, a total of 738 people running illegal pharmacy business have been arrested. This is besides 3,383 inspections the board has conducted in the last 10 months.
