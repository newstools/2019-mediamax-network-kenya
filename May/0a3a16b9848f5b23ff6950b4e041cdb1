Manchester, Monday @PeopleSport11 An hour after lifting his second Carabao Cup in February, Pep Guardiola stood inside a plush Wembley hospitality suite agitating to get away. Manchester City had laid on a winners’ reception for family and sponsors to joyously toast another trophy, but their manager had already moved on. Guardiola was pleasant, polite and graciously took the congratulations, yet his mind was elsewhere. He wore an occupied look and all those present knew it. Three more trophies were on the line at that stage. The biggest, and most significant, of those was the Premier League title – and retaining it. Liverpool played catch-up, with a deficit of two points. Guardiola longed to be back at the training ground studying videos, and back at his city centre restaurant, Tast, drinking tomato juice and plotting his next move. What has happened this season is testament to Guardiola, the first man since Sir Alex Ferguson in 2009 to retain the world’s toughest league after Sunday’s win at Brighton, where City equalled their own record for most victories in a campaign, 32. He told his players back in August to expect a Liverpool onslaught and was proven correct, the level of Jurgen Klopp’s wondrous team kicking City on to achieve a staggering 98 points. That is 198 points over the course of the last 76 games now – an average of 2.61 per match – and nobody is likely to rival the consistency of this set of players for a long, long time. ‘I didn’t expect to get the points we have this season so far after what we did last season,’ Guardiola said. ‘Normally the tendency for human beings is to relax a little bit.’ -DAILYMAIL
