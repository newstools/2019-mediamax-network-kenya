Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe The County Government of Siaya has finally paid the Sh37 .5 million bursary balance to schools. Education chief officer Peter Otieno said they  have cleared the 2017/18-bursary balance, which stood at Sh37.5 million and parents whose students qualified and were approved should check with the schools administration. Speaking in his office on Monday Otieno said  the 2018/19 bursary kitty which is Sh75 million will be released in the next two weeks. “The funds will also be released  to schools in two batches but will ensure funds get to schools to avoid its rollover,” he added. He said  documents of the new applicants are now being verified by County bursary committee after which the lists will be forwarded to Controller of Budget to re-verify before authorising the release of funds.
