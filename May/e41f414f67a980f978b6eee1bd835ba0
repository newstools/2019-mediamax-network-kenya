Barry Silah @obel_barry Modern Coast Rangers yesterday stunned Wazito 1-0 to allow Kisumu Allstars to move three points clear at the top of the National Super League (NSL) standings. As it stands, the lakeside team who won 2-0 against Eldoret Youth at Moi Stadium are on 63 points following goals by Shadrack Omondi and Ian Mtanda. The livewire Omondi now has 12 goals after scoring on five consecutive games. There were a couple of other interesting results in the second tier Championship during the Labour Day Round 30 as Shabana, Bidco United and Nairobi Stima got back to winning ways. Their feat comes  after bottom placed Kangemi Allstars earned only their fourth win of the campaign after humbling fellow strugglers Green Commandos 3-1 away at Bukhungu Stadium to push them a point above the Kakamega-based side. At Camp Toyoyo, Nairobi Stima moved to 58 points retaining fourth spot after a convincing 2-0 win over sixth-placed FC Talanta. Top scorer Dennis Oalo and towering defender Joseph Shikokoti claimed both goals in a pulsating encounter, which returned a smile on the face of coach George Owoko. “I am happy with the performance because the boys played to plan. What matters is ensuring we stay consistent. Dennis is a good addition to our side as he gives us a different dimension,” he told People Sports. Meanwhile Bidco United upset strong favourites Ushuru 2-0 at Thika Stadium courtesy of Michael Owino and Erick Obudho’s goals to push them to 48 points. The home team did everything according to plan as they frustrated Ken Kenyatta’s side all through, what with good defending and snap attacks that caught the taxmen off guard despite lining up an all-out attack. The loss keeps Ushuru still at third in the standings and in good position for promotion in the next season.
