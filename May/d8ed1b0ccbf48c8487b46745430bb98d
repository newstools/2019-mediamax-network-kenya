Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Orange Democratic Movement yesterday formed a three-member team to analyse the recommendations of a taskforce that indicted the party over how it conducted its party primaries in 2017. Nominated Senator Judith Pareno, Nyando MP Jared Okello and the ODM executive director Oduor Ong’wen will review the report of the taskforce before taking its final presentation to the National Executive Council (NEC). “ The NEC has formed a team…to come up with proposals on how best the party can implement recommendations in the report,” said ODM Director of Communications Philip Etale in a statement. During the meeting chaired by ODM chair John Mbadi and attended by party leader Raila Odinga, the executive council also gave the nod to the national secretariat to start preparations for grassroots elections scheduled for next year. The taskforce report said allegations of rigging in party primaries and poor dispute resolution mechanism were to blame for ODM’s poor performance in 2017 General Election.
