About 12 Kenya Defence Forces officers yesterday stormed the Diani Police Station cells and rescued a colleague who had been arrested and detained. Sgt Suleiman Hamisi Banda, 30, had reportedly gone to the station to demand for the release of his motorcycle detained by police over claims it had been used in criminal activities. The motorcycle was towed to the station after its  rider allegedly abandoned it by the roadside after being flagged down by police. Banda is said to have arrived at the station demanding for its release but the police refused and instead asked him to produce the rider who fled plus ownership documents. An argument reportedly ensued and turned into a fist fight. An hour later, a military truck ferrying 12 soldiers arrived at the station. The soldiers stormed the cell, rescued their colleague and took away the confiscated motorbike. Sensitive matter Police officers who spoke to People Daily on condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter said they are still in shock following the ordeal. “Our seniors watched from a distance without intervening. This kind of intimidation and harassment by our colleagues must stop, it has affected our morale, we are bitter,” said one police officers.
