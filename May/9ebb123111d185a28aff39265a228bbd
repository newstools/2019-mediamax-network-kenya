The High Court yesterday  suspended the hearing of former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero’s Sh213 million corruption case. Justice John Onyiego stayed the hearing of the case which was to begin next week, until   issues raised by Kidero concerning the case are heard and determined. Appeal “That hearing of proceedings in ACC32 of 2018 scheduled for May 6,  2019 are hereby stayed pending the delivery of this ruling on May 7, 2019 at 9am,” ruled Onyiengo. Kidero had filed an appeal at the High Court after trial magistrate Douglas Ogoti dismissed his application in which he claimed the charges were defective and that he ought to be tried separately. In his application, Kidero claims the magistrate erred in law by determining that the DPP’s decision to charge him and his 10 co-accused with the offence of conspiracy does not prejudice the former governor in any way. “The magistrate erred in law in failing to determine and hold that court one of conspiracy to commit an economic crime as framed in the charge sheet dated August 8, 2018 did not disclose an offence known in law,” says Kidero.
