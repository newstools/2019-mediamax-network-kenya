Immigration Principal Secretary Major-General (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa yesterday said terrorism is a major challenge of the 21st Century. Speaking during the opening of the second national conference for Sergeants-at-Arms in Naivasha, Kihalangwa urged for greater vigilance to prevent attacks. He particularly called for tighter security at the National Assembly and the Senate. The five-day conference brings together Sergeants-at-Arms from Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mauritius and all the Kenyan counties. “We are glad that no security threat has been reported in our  National Assembly or Senate but this is no reason to drop your guard,” he said. He challenged the officers to be alert, noting that Senate and the National Assembly are critical for the country’s governance, hence the need to enhance security. “Your job as Sergeant-at-Arms is not only about the safety of the mace but also about the honourable members and their wellbeing,” he said. Security alert Kihalangwa said with an increase in the number of visitors to the two Houses, there was need for security agents to be alert and heighten surveillance. “Parliament and nearby buildings have expanded and there is need to address the issue of security in the wake of increased cases of terror attacks,” he said. The PS also said corruption was a threat, and called on officers to be on the lookout for  fraudsters around Parliament Buildings.
