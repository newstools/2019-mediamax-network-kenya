South Africa is to lodge an appeal after Caster Semenya lost her case challenging new rules that require female athletes to regulate their testosterone levels. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland ruled on 1 May that female athletes with higher levels of testosterone must use treatment to suppress the hormone if they want to compete in sports events for women. Spokesman for the South African sport and recreation ministry, Vuyo Mhaga, said the appeal would be lodged as soon as possible. It was based on complaints over judges’ past record on similar cases, lack of clarity and the handling of evidence, he said. “We feel that the scientific information that has been brought has been actually completely ignored and we’ve got a belief that a different court will arrive at a different determination,” he said. The International Association of Athletics Federations argued that elevated testosterone gives athletes with Differences in Sexual Development (DSD) an unfair advantage. When asked if she would take the treatment, Semenya responded: “No way.” “I don’t know what will happen next,” she said. “But no one should tell me what to do, if people want to stop me from doing something that’s their problem, not mine.” -BBC
