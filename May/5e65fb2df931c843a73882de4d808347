Former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to accommodate all leaders in his bid to unite the country. He said Uhuru’s March 9, 2018 Handshake pact with Opposition leader Raila Odinga should not sideline other Nasa leaders regardless of their political inclinations. Muthama said, so far, the Handshake has only served to rock both Jubilee Party and the Opposition because Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula were left in the dark. “The Deputy President is always complaining since the Handshake happened. Uhuru must not appear to be taking sides as this will further split the country,” he said, adding that the President’s legacy is pegged on unity. Speaking on Sunday at the Africa Inland Church in Kangundo, Muthama also called for accelerated war on corruption.
