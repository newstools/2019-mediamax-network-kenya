A Machakos court yesterday allowed the police to hold three suspects linked to the death of a baby at Shalom Hospital, Machakos, for two more days to complete investigations. Vincent Njau Nganga, Irene Katete Mutinda and Odhiambo Kennedy were arrested on Monday after Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and a team of medics investigating the Sunday incident ordered the hospital closed. Seven-month-old Ethan Mwendo died after he was reportedly given an overdose of morphine. Yesterday, the investigating officer Peter Wafula asked senior resident magistrate Irene Kahuya to allow them to hold the suspects until May 9 to complete the probe. In his report, Wafula says the three were on duty on the fateful day and have  positively been identified as the ones who attended to the baby. Meanwhile, a postmortem analysis on what led to the death of the baby revealed he succumbed to respiratory depression. A preliminary autopsy report released on Tuesday by three pathologists who performed the postmortem at the Montenzuma and Monalisa funeral home in Machakos concluded that the baby’s brain was swollen.  The doctors said a conclusive report will be released after the analysis of the toxicological tests.
