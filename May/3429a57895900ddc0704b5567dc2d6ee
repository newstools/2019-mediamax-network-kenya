Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai yesterday held a meeting with financiers of the Kilimani Police Station upgrade programme amid fears the project has stalled. Led by the Kilimani Project Foundation leader lawyer Karanja Kabage, the team told the IG the programme is firmly on course. It involves upgrading of the station, construction of a new administration block and redevelopment of police houses. Once completed, the station will become a referral station for the country and the region. The Sh500 million project was launched by immediate former IG Joseph Boinnet in November 2016 but the project has not kicked off. The  project was supposed to be completed next year. “The deliberations revolved around the progress of the upgrade project and security issues of Kilimani area. Issues of community policing through police and civilian cooperation was also discussed,” a source who attended the meeting said. However, despite  issuing a formal invitation, the media briefing was cancelled at the last minute. The four partners in the project are Chinese Embassy, Kilimani Project Foundation, National Police Service and Nairobi County government. The project was set to start in January 2017 and be completed by December last year. So far, only a bore hole has been drilled.
