Mathew Ndung’u and Oliver Musembi @peopleDailyKe Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has criticised ODM leader Raila Odinga’s proposed constitutional amendment that could see Kenyans go for a referendum. Raila had proposed major constitutional amendments including a three-tier governance system which would most likely require a referendum. Kuria spoke days after Deputy President William Ruto sharply differed with Raila on the proposal to change the country’s governance structure. Ruto said the current system had not failed and hence did not see the need for a new one. Speaking on Sunday at Martyrs of Uganda Catholic Church in Gatundu during  a fundraiser  to facilitate  construction of a priest  house, Kuria urged the former prime minister to abandon his  quest for constitutional change saying  Kenyans have no time to engage in another political campaign. He said while Kenya required  constitutional amendments  to save the country from political crisis  every election  period, such exercise must be done through  Parliament. At the same time, Kuria called  on Mt Kenya political  heavyweights to settle  on their next political plan to avoid  being duped. “We should  stop the Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga groupings and sit as leaders from this region  to strategise  our next political  move,” he said. Uniform tenders Meanwhile, Kuria  and Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina have welcomed the government’s awarding of uniform tenders to local cloth manufacturing firms. Speaking separately, the two legislators said the move will not only create and sustain jobs but also go a long way towards boosting the manufacturing sector which is part of the Big Four agenda. “I do not see why the country should be importing uniforms and other clothing materials when we have local industries producing them. That money should be used to grow our economy,” said Kuria.
