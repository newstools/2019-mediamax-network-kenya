Tanzanian media mogul Reginald Mengi has died in Dubai. Mengi, who was born in a poor family from Kilimanjaro region in 1944, breathed his last on Wednesday night. The cause of his death and the reason for his visit to Dubai are still unclear. Mengi was regarded as a self-made tycoon, and a champion of philanthropy. Respected financial magazine Forbes estimated in 2014 that his net worth was $560m. His IPP Media Group owns a number of newspapers, television and radio stations. He also had stakes in mining operations – including gold, uranium, copper, chrome and coal – and in the mineral water and soft drinks business. Mengi is survived by his wife, former Miss Tanzania Jacqueline Ntuyabaliwe, and four children. -BBC
