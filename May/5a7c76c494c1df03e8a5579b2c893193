Naftali Kinuthia, who is accused of killing Moi University medical student Ivy Wangeci, yesterday pleaded not guilty to the charges before Eldoret High Court judge Stephen Githinji. Kinuthia was accused of killing Wangeci on April 13  in an  incident that shocked the country. He allegedly hacked her with an axe before slitting her throat in broad daylight before he was cornered and roughed up by a mob. Police saved him from the angry crowd. Kinuthia has been in  custody at Naiberi Police Station in Eldoret East. Lawyer Vallary Nyakinywa, for Wangeci’s family, had asked the court to move the case to Nairobi citing travel expenses for the family of the slain student. She said moving the case would also spare the family the painful memories of her killing in Eldoret. However, Justice Githinji dismissed  the plea and maintained that the case will be heard and determined in Eldoret since the court had not seen reasonable grounds to have it moved. The accused’s  lawyer asked  the court to grant his client bail since he is not a flight risk, among other requests. A medical examination of the accused was also presented before the court which proved he was in the right state of mind. The court will rule on the  bail plea on  May 9, while the case will  be heard on June 10.
