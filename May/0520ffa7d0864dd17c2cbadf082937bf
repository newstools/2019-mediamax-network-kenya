Of the two hospitals that received the equipment, it is only in Kitale County Referral Hospital that they are fully functional. At the Endebess sub-county hospital, most of the modern machines lie idle. Trans Nzoia Health executive Clare Wanyama said theatre and radiology equipment at the Endebess  hospital are not utilised, citing staffing challenge. This means residents seeking the services at the hospital are referred elsewhere, yet the county continues to pay for the equipment. More space “There were no proper consultations before the delivery of the equipment and that is why some are still lying idle. There were no prior logistics on how to install them,” the CEC told People Daily on Saturday. “We need more space for the theatre and radiology machines. Staffing is also a challenge, and it is not unique to Trans Nzoia,” she added. Wanyama said the county needs to overhaul power installation at the hospital at a cost of Sh1.8 million to accommodate the machines. “We are working with Kenya Power Company on this but it may take  a while,  because the budget process must be followed,” she said. But at the Kitale Referral Hospital, the equipment have been installed are fully functional. “Specialised services are now available to the locals unlike in the past when they had to travel to Eldoret and other places,” said Wanyama, adding that the equipment are critical in realising the government’s bid for Universal Health Coverage. “The staff handling the equipment were trained but there is need for continuous training for even better results,” she said. The county collectively X-ray machines, dialysis machines, theatre equipment and other imaging machines in a programme that cost the National government Sh38 billion.
