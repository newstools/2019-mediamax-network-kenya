Bernard Gitau @benagitau The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is contemplating driving hundreds of buffaloes from Lake Nakuru National Park to a neighbouring conservancy to ease pressure on the ecosystem. The park has been experiencing influx of buffaloes above the standard carrying capacity which has been termed a challenge. Speaking to People Daily, KWS spokesman Paul Gathitu said the park has a carrying capacity of 500 buffaloes against the over 4,500 currently. “Their high number is a challenge as they are depleting the grazing land and this would lead to environment degradation,” he said. To address the issue, Gathitu said KWS management is exploring possibility of translocating some buffaloes to Soysambu Conservancy to ease the pressure.
