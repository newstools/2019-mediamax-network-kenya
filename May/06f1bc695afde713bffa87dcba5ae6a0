Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The High Court yesterday prohibited nine members appointed to the Postal Corporation of Kenya and Tana and Athi rivers Development boards from assuming office. Justice John Mativo suspended the appointment of Mike Rubia, Fred Gachie, Munyua Waiyaki, Simon Kiuta, Pauline Muthangani, James Muriithi, Jane Githinji, Ndogo Waweru and Robert Murimito, pending hearing and determination of an application filed by Chama cha Mawakili. The firm, through lawyer Paul Ogedi, had sued Information and Communication Technology Cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru and his East African Community and Regional Development counterpart Adan Mohammed over the appointments made on May 3, saying they did not meet the constitutional requirement of ethnic and regional balance. The matter will be mentioned on June 5.
