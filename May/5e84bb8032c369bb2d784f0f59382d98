Mutuku Mwangangi @PitzPitah Pathologists have said baby Ethan Muendo died of medical poisoning. Dr Waithera Njenga (Government) and Dr Daniel Zuria of Kenyatta National Hospital representing the family issued a unanimous report that there was evidence of reduced oxygen circulation in the seven-month-old boy. “The brain appears swollen but the rest of the organs are basically fit. The primary finding is that there was respiratory depression due to swelling of the brain as a result of the intoxication,” they said. The medics affirmed there was a medical intervention prior to the death of the minor barely two hours after the lethal injection. During yesterday’s postmortem exercise at Montezuma Funeral home in Machakos, the infant’s father, who is also a KBC correspondent in Machakos, Jonathan Muendo could not control his emotions. Samples of the brain, liver and body fluids have been extracted for toxicology analysis by the government chemist to establish the chemicals present and their ratio.
