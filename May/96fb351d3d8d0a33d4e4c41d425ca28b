London, Sunday Chelsea boosted secured Champions League football next season with victory over Watford at Stamford Bridge moving them up to third in the Premier League. After a quiet first half, Chelsea scored twice within three minutes early in the second period through headers by Ruben Loftus-Cheek and David Luiz. Gonzalo Higuain sealed the points with a neat finish from Pedro’s pass for his fifth goal for the club. The win moves Chelsea one point ahead of Tottenham and four points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who drew 1-1 with Brighton later on Sunday to all but seal the Blues’ slot in Europe’s elite competition next season. FA Cup finalists Watford started brightly, going close through Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu, but were left to rue their slow start to the second half that saw Chelsea quickly take the game away from them. The Hornets, who stay 10th, have now won just one of their past five Premier League games since their FA Cup semi-final victory over Wolves last month. Chelsea’s Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt is finely poised at 1-1 after the first leg, but Maurizio Sarri could not afford to rest players as he looked to maintain their push for a top-four finish. Arsenal’s top-four hopes are all but-over after being held to the 1-1 draw. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Arsenal the perfect start in their final home game of the season, slotting home from the penalty spot after Nacho Monreal went down in the area following a challenge from Alireza Jahanbakhsh. But Brighton came back into the game and equalised through Glenn Murray, who converted from the penalty spot as Granit Xhaka fouled Solly March. -AGENCIES
