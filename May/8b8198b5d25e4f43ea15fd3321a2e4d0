Controversy has erupted between three MPs and Kirinyaga Governor Anne WaiguruÂ following the sacking of more than 200 casual workers last week. John Wambugu (Kirinyaga Central), Gichimu Githinji (Gichugu) and Wachira Kabinga (Mwea) have asked Waiguru to reinstate the workers, failure to which they would take legal action. Speaking at Kagumo Catholic Church yesterday, the MPs said they would finance the suit against the county government. They accused the Governor of being insensitive and out of touch with residents. The MPs said the ongoing demolition of kiosks was further evidence of an administration which does not care about the interest of the people. The county government said it would save Sh48 million annually by laying off the workers. County Secretary Joe Muriuki said the wage bill was unsustainable.
