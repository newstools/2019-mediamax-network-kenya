Alvin MwangiÂ @PeopleDailyKe The 2022 succession politics is picking momentum after former National Youth Council chairman Arnold Maliba presented interim documents for the yet to be registered Transformation National Alliance (TNA) party to the Office of Registrar of Political Parties. Maliba is reportedly allied to one wing of the warring Jubilee factions even as he denied claims the outfit is financed by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria for his 2022 presidential ambitions. Kuria rekindled hopes of reviving TNA a week ago saying Jubilee Party has not been representing their interests. It is alleged that some legislators allied to Deputy President William Ruto have been backing the idea to revive the now defunct TNA party. Jubilee has been pulling apart at the seams with the emergence of two movements Tanga Tanga and Kielweke who have been disagreeing publicly. Political pundits say the revival of TNA, the party that sponsored President Uhuru Kenyatta to the presidency in the first term, is to give refuge to those who felt orphaned by the dissolution that had merged 15 parties.
