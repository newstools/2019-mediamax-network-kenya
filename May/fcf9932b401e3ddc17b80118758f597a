The taxman has cautioned all businesses that primarily use the internet to supply or receive goods and services to pay up what belongs to caesar or face up to unspecified number of consequences. In an advertisement appearing in the local dailies, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said that it had noted that a number of online businesses have been evading tax. “KRA would like to advise that unless income or supply is expressly exempt in law, appropriate taxes should apply,” read the statement. “KRA would, therefore, like to remind taxpayers that the self-assessment regime requires them to file and pay taxes which may include VAT, excise duty, withholding tax, PAYE, corporate taxes and any other tax obligation under the business.” Sources at KRA said that they were yet to receive any guidelines on what ‘appropriate’ taxes were but were confident that such a memo would be made public soon. E-commerce platforms are bound to be hit hard by the announcement. Websites that drive up traffic and are in turn paid for providing online advertising platforms are also bound to be affected although it is not clear how the tax calculation will be done.
