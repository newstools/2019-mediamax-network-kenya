London, Tuesday Congratulations have poured in from around the world following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s son. The newborn was delivered at 05:26 BST on Monday, with Prince Harry saying the baby boy was “absolutely to die for”. The Palace said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales were all “delighted with the news”. Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, was said to be “overjoyed”, while former US First Lady Michelle Obama said she and Barack were “thrilled”. The baby, who has not been named yet, is seventh in line to the throne, behind the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and his children—Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis—and Prince Harry. He is the Queen’s eighth great-grandchild. Speaking after the birth, Harry said they planned to present the baby to the media in two days’ time “so everyone can see” him. He said Meghan and the baby were doing “incredibly well”, adding that they were still thinking about names for the infant. Arthur—a traditional royal name that is among middle names of the baby’s grandfather—is the favourite with many of the bookies, while Alexander and James are also popular. -BBC
