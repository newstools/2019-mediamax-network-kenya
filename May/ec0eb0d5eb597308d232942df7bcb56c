The felling of forests, the plundering of seas and soils, and the pollution of air and water are together pushing the natural world to the brink. That is the warning more than 500 experts in 50 countries gave in a major UN-backed report released yesterday. The document, from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), has set out an urgent rescue plan for nature. So what do we know about the health of the planet in terms of biodiversity (the variety of living things on Earth and the ecosystems they belong to)? 1.  The world’s biodiversity is vanishing fast The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is a critical measure of our impact on nature. Almost 100,000 species have been assessed so far for this inventory of endangered species. Of these, more than a quarter are threatened with extinction. 2. Among the biggest threats to wildlife are habitat loss, climate change and pollution According to a recent study, while climate change is a growing threat, the main drivers of biodiversity decline continue to be the loss of natural habitat to farming for food, fuel and timber, and the over exploitation of plants and animals by humans through logging, hunting and fishing. 3. Animals and plants are disappearing and so is the land they rely upon for natural habitat Land degradation through human activities is negatively affecting the well-being of at least 3.2 billion people and pushing the planet towards a sixth mass extinction, according to IPBES. 4.  Habitat conversion drives biodiversity loss According to IPBES, only a quarter of land on Earth is substantively free of the impacts of human activities. This is projected to decline to just one-tenth by 2050. 5. Some of the last great rainforests are being wiped out The Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world. Over time, the landscape becomes a mixture of cleared fields, settlements and fragments of forest. -BBC
