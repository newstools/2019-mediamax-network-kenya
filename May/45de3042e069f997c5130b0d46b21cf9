George Kebaso @Morarak The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has given the owners of 647 vehicles two months to take them for inspection at the nearest NTSA vehicle inspection centres. In a public notice yesterday,  NTSA said had established that critical registration details of 469 civilian motor vehicles and 178 trailers, tractors, three-wheelers and heavy machinery vehicles, were missing in its records. “The vehicles must be presented for inspection by June 5, 2019,” NTSA director general Francis Meja (pictured) said in a tweet. Logbook Owners of the vehicles have been asked to carry with them the original and a copy of the certificate of registration (Logbook), importation documents, national ID and Kenya Revenue Authority Personal Identification Number (KRA PIN) certificate and any other documents to prove ownership. In the meantime, the NTSA has restricted any transactions on the listed vehicles. Reacting to NTSA’s notice, Kenyans on social media demanded that NTSA staff be investigated. “This is one organisation that, it seems, is staffed with criminals. From issuing same number plates to various car owners, to missing records in these days of Information Technology is something of concern,” one Kenyan wrote on social media. In March, NTSA reshuffled its top management which affected 227 staff members. The changes followed the January 8 Dusit D2 terror attack, where one of the vehicles believed to have been used by the terrorists was found to share registration number with another vehicle. Vacant posts The agency also advertised the positions of Director Registration and Licensing, Director Road Safety, Deputy Supply Chain, Deputy Director Motor Vehicle Inspection, Manager Supply Chain and Manager ICT.
