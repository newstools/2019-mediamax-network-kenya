With his star on an undeniable rise, singer Guardian Angel is making bigger strides this year and his strategic thinking (read team) has seen him land a number of corporate deals. This time round, he is set to perform at this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok. This follows the release of his song; Kenya, which was done in collaboration with the Permanent Presidential Music Commission. “This song is a reminder to my fellow countrymen that God loves Kenya and it’s a beautiful country. Despite the many challenges we have, Kenya is still a blessed country with many opportunities, a rich history and very hardworking citizens. We should continue to pray and work hard to make it a better place for us and generations to come. A big thank you to the team at The Presidential Music Commission for bringing this idea to life.” He told PD Wikendi.
