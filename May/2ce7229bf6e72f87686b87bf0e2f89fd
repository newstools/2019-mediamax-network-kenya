KAMPALA Uganda’s ministry of health has started a crackdown on illegal medicine dealers that are compromising health service provision in the east African country. Ruth Aceng, minister of health told reporters on Thursday that in the ongoing operation, 35 suspects have been arrested over the last two months, 83 drug shops closed and 981 boxes of assorted medical items valued at over 490 million shillings (about 135,000 U.S. dollars) impounded. Aceng said some of the drugs were counterfeit, while others were meant for public health facilities but not for sale. She said the suspects had the intention of selling medicine meant for public health facilities to the private sector or export them to neighboring countries. Aceng said some of the suspects, who have no knowledge of handling medicine, were arrested while hawking in make-shift markets. “Unfortunately, some individuals have taken-up hawking of medicine as a livelihood. Such individuals sell substandard, fake, and counterfeit medicines,” she said. (Xinhua)
