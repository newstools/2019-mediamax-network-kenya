Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA) seeks to raise Kenya’s pension asset to Sh2.4 trillion as well as increasing coverage to 30 per cent, mainly from those working in the informal sector in the next five years. According to the RBA Strategic Plan 2019-2024, which was launched yesterday, but will be  effective on July 1, the authority seeks to create an all-inclusive, secure and growing retirement benefits sector. The plan intends to rope in workers from the informal sector (Jua Kali) who lack access to social security and therefore have little to support them especially when they retire from what they do. Chief executive officer, Nzomo Mutuku, said RBA wants to develop specific products meant to enhance pension coverage in the informal sector. They plan to use mobile phones to reach individuals in the informal sector.“We shall develop need-based outreach programmes to reach out to those Kenyans who are outside the pension scheme,” he said. He said RBA will create awareness and use ICT to reach those in the informal sector so that they enrol in any of the pension programme. National Treasury Cabinet Secretary, Henry Rotich, said the pension’s sub-sector has an asset base of Sh1.2 trillion, which is nearly 14 per cent of the country’s GDP and it is growing. Speaking yesterday during the launch of the five-year Strategic Plan, the CS said the resources accumulated for pension are poised to contribute significantly towards financing the Big Four development initiatives, which aim to raise the share of the manufacturing sector to 15 per cent of GDP.
