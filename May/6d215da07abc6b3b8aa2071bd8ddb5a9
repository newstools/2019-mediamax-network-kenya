Barry Silah @PeopleSports11 Wazito FC are keen to maintain their momentum in the National Super League (NSL) when they welcome second from bottom Green Commandos at Camp Toyoyo this morning. The NSL leaders have 66 points, one ahead of second-placed Kisumu AllStars and two adrift of Nairobi Stima in third place, and are looking to pile more misery on Green Commandos to maintain their chase for an immediate return to the SportPesa Premier League. Fred Ambani’s side silenced Fortune Sacco 2-0 in their last clash while Green Commandos, who have only picked 24 points from 32 matches, are slightly buoyed by last weekend’s 1-0 away win over Kibera Black Stars. However, it will be a difficult task for the Kakemega-based side to down Wazito, given they have the best attack and one of the tightest defences in the division. While Wazito are keen to retain their place at the summit, AllStars and Stima will also be out to capitalise on any slip-ups as well as fourth-placed Ushuru who are six points behind the leaders. AllStars have a tricky fixture at home to 10th-placed Coast Stima today while Ushuru, who have slipped from the promotion places, take on St Joseph’s Youth, who occupy 14th place. “At this point, no team is a pushover and we must give our best. Our opponents are a good side and we must respect them. Being at home, it is important that we pick the points but we will have to work hard,” said AllStars coach Francis Oduor. AllStars and Ushuru played to a barren draw last weekend, extending the taxmen’s recent poor run, making the game against St Joseph’s a must-win given there are six games left.
