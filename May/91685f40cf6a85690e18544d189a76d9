Two leading scholars have welcomed Education Cabinet secretary George Magoha’s concerns over the qualifications of some university lecturers. Speaking in Kiambu on Saturday, a University of Nairobi law professor Kiarie Mwaura and Macharia Munene, a former long serving professor of history at  the UoN, called for a thorough probe into how some of the degrees were awarded in some universities to safeguard the credibility of the country’s higher education. Credible PhDs Prof Magoha recently told a Parliamentary committee that out of 10 PhDs in the country, only one is credible, raising concern over the qualifications of some of the university lecturers. He later directed the Commission for Higher Education to conduct a fact-finding exercise of the issuance of university degrees and recommend remedial measures. The two lecturers  said Magoha’s concerns  over the state of Kenya’s university education were valid and hence the need for a probe.
