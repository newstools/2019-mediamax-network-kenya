Dozens of gunmen attacked two villages in Katsina state, north-western Nigeria and killed 14 villagers, a politician and local police say. The politician, who represents the area in the state’s parliament, Abdul Jalal Haruna Runka, told the BBC the attackers on motorbikes went on the rampage in the villages on Tuesday evening shooting people and burning houses. Many people were also injured in Gobirawa and Sabawa villages. This is the second time in a week that gunmen attacked the area killing several people and injuring others. There’s growing concern in northern Nigeria over the level of banditry and kidnapping in the states of Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna. The states have long faced problems with armed groups stealing cattle, kidnapping for ransom and attacking communities, which has in turn prompted some local people to form vigilante gangs. The Nigerian government has deployed troops to the region but that has yet to bring the violence to an end. -BBC
