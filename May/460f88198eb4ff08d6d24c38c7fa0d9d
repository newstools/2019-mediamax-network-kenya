Wazito moved to within a point of leaders Kisumu Allstars in the National Super League standings following a 5-2 drubbing of Kenya Police yesterday. The match, held at Camp Toyoyo grounds, saw Derrick Onyango grab a brace as Victor Ndinya, Wilson Anekeya and Amos Asembeka also scored for the promotion chasers. Wazito took a 3-0 lead after 40 minutes with Teddy Osok and Zachary Gathu running the show as the law enforcers looked lost. Even though they grabbed two goals in the space of seven minutes from  David Oluoch and Abraham Dawo Police could not summon enough energy to down the well-drilled Wazito. “It is an embarrassing defeat but we must learn from it and improve fast,” said Police coach Charles Omondi. The sees Wazito, who lost 1-0 to Modern Coast Rangers in their last match moved to 63 points, just behind leaders Allstars who recorded a goalless stalemate against Bidco United at Thika Stadium. In another duel, Administration Police fought back to pick a point following a 2-2 draw with 17th placed Nairobi City Stars to amass 43 points same as Coast Stima, who tied 1-1, with visiting Coast Stima. AP controlled the match, taking the lead twice but allowed struggling City Stars back into the game due to lack of concentration. Meanwhile, Ulinzi Stars and KCB concluded round 28 of the SportPesa Premier League by claiming 1-0 and 2-0 wins over Nzoia Sugar and Mt Kenya United in Nakuru and Machakos respectively yesterday.
