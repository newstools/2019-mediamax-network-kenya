George Kebaso @Morarak The tenure of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Gen Samson Mwathethe officially came to an end yesterday night amidst speculation that he could be retained on a one-year contract. Silence from the Executive and the Ministry of Defence raised doubts on whether he will leave office at the end of his term. His term ended on April 23, when he was appointed, but officially ended last night, the day he assumed office. Top on the list to succeed Mwathethe is his vice Robert Kibochi, Army Commander Walter Raria and Leonard Ngondi, the force commander of the AU-UN Hybrid operation in Darfur, Sudan. Extend term It is not yet known whether President Uhuru Kenyatta has received a report from the National Defence Council, which met when Mwathethe’s term ended, to make a decision on his replacement. Mwathethe was appointed the country’s eighth CDF on April 23, 2015 replacing Gen Julius Karangi from the Kenya Air Force. Under the Tonje Rules, the position of the CDF is rotated among the three services- Kenya Army, Kenya Air Force and the Navy. Retired Chief of General Staff Gen Daudi Tonje drafted rules that have informed appointments. There are speculations, however, that Uhuru, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed forces will extend Mwathethe’s term by a year. The KDF Act says that  a CDF, his vice and service commanders serve a single term of four yeas or retire upon attaining the mandatory retirement age. But the Act also says the President may, on the recommendation of the defence council, extend the CDF’s term for a period not exceeding one year in times of war or emergencies like political uncertainty. It is not clear though what the council decided when it met.  There is, however silent lobbying among those hoping to take over from Mwathethe. “The President is equally aware of the intense campaign within the military ranks on those keen to succeed Mwathethe, who has generally performed well,” an officer close to the process told People Daily.
