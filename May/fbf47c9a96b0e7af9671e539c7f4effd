Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe A female robbery suspect wanted by Kenyan security agents and the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) has been arrested by detectives at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). Margaret Waithira Kamande was seized Friday as she reportedly tried to escape to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. She is linked to several armed robberies, house break-ins targeting high-end estates particularly in Kilimani and Kileleshwa areas in Nairobi. Zimbabwean authorities have also been looking for her after she jumped bail in a burglary case. “She is also wanted by Interpol in Zimbabwe and other East African countries after she jumped bail which was granted by a Zimbabwean court in offences related to house breaking, burglary and stealing. She has been on the run until her arrest,” Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said. Detectives described her as a notorious robber. A team of investigators has been trailing her movements to unravel her nature of operations and accomplices. She was included in Interpol’s list of wanted persons after she jumped bail in Zimbabwe. Kamande was later arrested with two others in a Tanzanian nightclub and the three were found with master keys and a crowbar believed to have been used in forced entry into homes. Police said members of the gang pose as workers from water or electricity companies during their robbery missions.
