George Kebaso @Morarak Community radio stations, regarded as the main source of information for rural and informal settlement populations, are gaining popularity as purveyors of fake news and misinformation, a new report by the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) states. In the report released yesterday, the radio stations, mostly broadcasting in languages best understood by their target audience, came second with 29 per cent after social media at 35 per cent. Selling land that in some cases doesn’t exist, discussing witchcraft, sports betting and lewd sex-motivated discussions in most of the radio shows are some the main reasons why radio is now deemed as a purveyor of fake news. “Some listeners are becoming angry about the sex discussions on radio and are asking us to do something. We are receiving complaints daily on the misuse of airtime by community radios,” MCK chief executive David Omwoyo said yesterday ahead of today’s World Press Freedom Day (WPFD).  He said MCK has written warning letters to some radio presenters and will ask authorities to act against those promoting sex talk on radio.
