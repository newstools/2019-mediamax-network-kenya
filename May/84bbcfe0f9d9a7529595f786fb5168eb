Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Hundreds of learners with disabilities in public schools are yet to benefit from the Sh30 billion Digital Learning Programme. A joint National Assembly and Senate committee on ICT and Education said no infrastructure has been put in place to cater for learners with special needs. Speaking in Eldoret at the weekend after inspecting the progress of the programme in several schools, Nominated Senator Gertrude Musuruve said deaf and blind learners are the most affected, with no special digital devices for them. “Some of the schools we have visited have not factored in learners with disability when rolling out the programme,” she said. Musuruve  said most learners with disability drop out school  due to the various challenges and urged the government to address the matter. West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio urged the government to address learners’ woes in marginalised areas, most of who, he said, lack proper classrooms.
