Paris, Tuesday @PeopleSport11 The death of Ayrton Senna 25 years ago changed Formula One’s attitude to safety to such an extent that only one driver, Jules Bianchi in 2014, has since suffered a fatal accident. In 1994, Formula One had gone eight years without a death. After 10 drivers died in the 1970s, only four were killed in the 1980s, the last was Elio de Angelis in 1986. Then came the black weekend at Imola at the start of May 1994 when Roland Ratzenberger died in qualifying on the Saturday and Senna in the race on the Sunday. Those deaths rocked the drivers and the international motorsports federation (FIA). “We got too confident that the dangerous times were over,” Senna’s former team-mate Gerhard Berger, told AFP. An Italian court eventually blamed a break in a hastily adapted steering column on Senna’s Williams car for the crash. Bad design “Regardless of whether that steering column caused the accident or not, there is no escaping the fact that it was a bad piece of design that should never have been allowed to get on the car,” said Adrian Newey, who helped design the car and is considered the best F1 engineer, wrote in his autobiography in 2017. He also wrote that the crash was linked to the instability of the Williams. After the car hit a concrete wall on the Tamburello corner at more than 200 km/h, the right front wheel and suspension were hurled into the cockpit. A piece of metal hit Senna’s head and killed him. In the following days, drivers, including Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda and Berger, reformed the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association and called for a reduction in speed, which was introduced for the Spanish Grand Prix at the end of May. By Canada in mid-June, the cockpit had been lengthened and reinforced and the suspension strengthened.The next season, 1995, brought higher norms for crash tests. In 1996, the protection round the driver’s head was reinforced. In 1998, the wheels were attached to the car by tethers to stop them flying off.  -AFP
