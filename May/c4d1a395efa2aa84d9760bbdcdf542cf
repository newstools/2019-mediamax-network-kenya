The Ministry of Devolution will partner with the University of Nairobi to promote the gubernatorial system of governance through a rights sensitisation programme. Announcing the plans at the university on Tuesday, Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa (pictured) said his ministry would co-opt students to spearhead civic education campaigns in the counties and ensure devolution is effective. Wamalwa said most people do not understand their rights and thus lack the capacity to question their leaders’ on accountability of resources. “An informed citizen is an empowered citizen and Kenya’s devolution is considered one of the most radical and rapid,” he said. He said the main aim for devolution is to give power back to the people and to allow residents participate in decision-making in their counties. “Wananchi have the right to be involved in all county processes through different forums,” he added. Wamalwa noted that corruption is one of the key challenges strangling devolution and thus derails development in some counties despite the huge amounts allocated by the national government.
