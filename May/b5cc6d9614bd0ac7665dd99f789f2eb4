Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The anticipated Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) polls slated for late this month have been moved to June 8 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Nairobi. The decision follows a consensus reached after outgoing KNCCI chairman Kiprono Kittony convened a meeting of all Muslim chamber leaders and presidential candidates after they sought to have the elections conducted immediately after the holy month of Ramadhan which ends on June 4. “Yes, the elections have been moved from May 28 to June 8,” chairman of the Independent Elections Board (IEB) Benjamin Onkobo said. Among those who approved the new dates include the chamber’s presidential position contenders Richard Ngatia and James Mureu. Another month However, demands by Abdulwalli Shariff, a third presidential contender to have the elections postponed by another month were rejected by Muslim leaders and the chamber leadership. Shariff’s request also contravenes the chamber guidelines on the tenure of office of the national chairman which is time specific according to its constitution. Mureu launched his manifesto in Mombasa early last month while Ngatia unveiled his six points agenda during a ceremony at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre two weeks ago. Ngatia promised to establish a special chamber fund to offer affordable interest rates guided by strict lending regulations. During the launch of Ngatia’s manifesto, Equity Bank Managing director Polycarp Igathe said the chamber could be advanced Sh150 billion currently invested in government bonds.
