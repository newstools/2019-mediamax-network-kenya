Coffee earnings dropped by Sh2.7 billion in the last seven months since beginning of the 2018/19 coffee year, a market report by the Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) shows. The exchange mandated to manage the country’s coffee central auction attributed the situation to drop in prices at the New York Coffee Exchange (NYCE) and declining quality of the local beans. Data released by NCE yesterday revealed that the value of coffee sold through the auction dropped by 23.42 per cent from $116.88 million (Sh11.688 billion) to about $89.51 million (Sh8.951 billion) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Mbithi explained that the month of April, 2018 was among the most difficult in trading globally and locally, in terms of prices. “It is the month we witnessed Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in New York get below $1.98 (Sh198) per kilogramme or 90 cents per pound mark,” he said. This is the lowest monthly average since July 2006 when the price reached 88.57 US cents (Sh194) per pound at the NYCE. Mbithi said volumes traded through the exchange increased from 25,301 tonnes in 2018 to 25,660 tonnes in similar period this year, representing a slight increment of 1.42 per cent. Review period Average prices during the review period, he said, equally slipped by 24.49 per cent from $230.98 (Sh23,098) to $174.41 (Sh17,441) per 50kg. Interim director in charge of Coffee Directorate, Isabella Nkonge attributed the global low prices to increasing surplus mainly from the leading coffee growing countries. “Locally, we have a challenge of the climate change thus affecting the quality of the beans. Quality during the review period has not been as good as those of the previous years,” she said. Even though Kenya is reputed for producing fine Arabica coffee that fetches the top prices in the world, market volumes have been declining since early 1990s. The International Coffee Organisation composite indicator shows prices, mainly for Arabica and robusta fell in April this year.
