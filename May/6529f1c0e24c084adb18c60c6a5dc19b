Kisumu branch executive secretary Zablon Awange and his Migori counterpart Samuel Orwa said lowering the entry grades for joining teachers training colleges would have compromised the quality of education. “We support the decision to reverse on the TTC minimum entry grades. We must get qualified people with good grades to teach our children,” said Awange. The Kuppet official urged affected students to join technical training institutes for pursuance of alternative courses of their choice. Speaking to People Daily yesterday, they at the same asked the ministry to deploy more teachers to address the current shortages and boost new education curriculum implementation. Ends
