Counties will have to wait longer before accessing an extra Sh25 billion grant after National Assembly rejected the proposal by the Senate. Senate had proposed the increment of the revenue to counties to Sh335 billion. Members also rejected  amendments made to the Division of Revenue Bill seeking to allocate another Sh6 billion set as a conditional allocation towards the controversial leased medical equipment. Senate had considered the bill passed to them from the National Assembly, which had pegged the allocations to counties at Sh310 billion, but amended the same by asking for the devolved units to be granted more monies. But yesterday, the National Assembly rejected the proposal even as they accused their counterparts of failing to follow basic principles of budgeting by not indicating where they wanted the extra Sh25 billion sourced from. Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Kimani Ichungwa moved the report of his committee where they had considered the proposed amendment by Senate and led the House in rejecting proposed changes, calling for representatives of the two Houses to go for a mediation.
