Liverpool, Monday @PeopleSports Liverpool emerged victorious from a bruising battle against Newcastle to remain in the hunt for the Premier League title, but may have sustained too many wounds to summon a Champions League semi-final comeback against Barcelona on Tuesday. A late double from Lionel Messi in the Camp Nou on Wednesday has left Jurgen Klopp’s men with a mountain to climb to overturn a 3-0 first leg defeat if they are to reach a second consecutive Champions League final. Liverpool have overcome such deficits before in the Champions League, most famously in the 2005 final against AC Milan. But hopes of another famous European comeback at fortress Anfield were dealt a blow when Mohamed Salah was stretchered off with a head knock as Liverpool edged out Newcastle 3-2 on Saturday to move two points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Salah watched a thrilling end to the match at St. James’ Park in the dressing room as his replacement Divock Origi headed home fellow substitute Xherdan Shaqiri’s free-kick four minutes from time. Origi, who also scored a 96th-minute winner to beat Everton in the Merseyside derby in December, Shaqiri and Daniel Sturridge have made important contributions in a supporting role to a club record points tally for Liverpool this season. “We are always ready to get on the pitch and make a difference,” said Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson. “The lads who have been left at home and lads who are on the bench and haven’t come on, they are buzzing for us. “There’s no egos in this squad and that’s why we are where we are today and long may it continue.” However, with Roberto Firmino already ruled out due to a groin injury, few would give Liverpool any hope of overhauling a three-goal deficit without two of their prolific front three should Salah not start. -AFP
