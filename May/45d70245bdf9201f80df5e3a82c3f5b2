Integration of banks and CBAs is changing the credit market in fundamental ways. Patrick Mwangi talks to KBA director of research Jared Osoro (pictured) on the relationship between banks and CRBs. QUESTION: What has been the impact of CRBs? ANSWER: CRBs role is to bridge the informational assymetry that existed between the lender and the borrower.  CRBs provide credit information in a manner that is systematic. They assist lenders to make two key decisions – credit decisions and pricing decisions. Q: Is the CRB rating an absolute, that lenders will not consider loan applications from anybody with negative credit history? A: The lender should not make a credit decision based purely on the information from CRB. CRBs were not established as a way of outsourcing credit appraisal by lenders. It is just part of the information that is available to a lender when they make decisions on who and why to loan. Credit information should go beyond blacklisting. It should assist you get better terms. It did not help that the sequencing of the CRB rollout started with negative information only – that it was merely a blacklist. Now it has moved into full file, where lenders must provide both positive and negative information and capture all borrowers, not just defaulters. Q: Who regulates CRBs? A: They are regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya. Note, however, that CBK does not control the entire credit market, but other players complement this information. Q: What are banks allowed to provide to CRBs and what should not be referred? A: The information that banks refer to CRB is purely credit information- they must have given you credit. Bank charges and other obligations that accumulate as a consequence of account operations  are not part of your credit history. Q: Is it justifiable to ruin people’s creditworthiness because of say Sh500? A: If your credit history deteriorates, then that information needs to be captured. Nothing stops you from explaining why your credit is in default.  Please note, it is not about the quantum. It is about your attitude towards debt repayment. Q: The problems of non-performing loans in the banking sector continues unabated. Would you say CRBs have failed in their mission? A: The fact is that CRBs are not a solution to the quality of assets. Note that CRBs come at the tail end of the process. If the economy is tanking and defaults are rising, the CRB reports will be derived from this dynamic. Rising defaults are not the fault of CRBs. Q: What if erroneous information is given to CRBs? Where are the checks, and what is the remedy? A: The issue is how CRBs handle complaints. There has to be a mechanism to correct some of these issues and a remedy. Reputation is everything, so if one threatens you or gives erroneous information, that must be remedied. Q: Which countries have managed CRBs well, and with what impact? A: India and Turkey have very good credit information sharing systems, as do many of the big emerging markets. Credit drives economic activities and so mechanisms that facilitate credit are critical.
