They smile and jump in short skirts and tight tops in front of frenzied crowds — but this is cricket, not a Bollywood set or a Mumbai nightclub. They may not know the rules of Twenty20 cricket, but the cheerleaders who follow the eight Indian Premier League (IPL) teams have become a key part of the success of the world’s wealthiest cricket tournament that will stage a new final on Sunday. Traditionally, when a batsman hits a six into the crowd, he lifts his bat to acknowledge the applause. But when Delhi Capitals star batsman Rishabh Pant bashes a ball into the stand, he unleashes an explosion of music, smoke and flying pom-poms. The dancers — who come from Britain, Brazil, Canada, Russia, South Africa and other countries — keep grinning and kicking even when temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). When the IPL dancers started in 2008, some politicians wanted them banned because their skimpy outfits were considered un-Indian — and Royal Challengers Bangalore now have more soberly dressed, mixed male-female cheerleaders. But there are few complaints now. Criss-cross schedule The troupes follow the teams on a gruelling criss-cross schedule across India for eight weeks each year. The players get luxury flights and hotels, while the women take the budget version. “There are a lot of rules — don’t look at them, don’t smile at them,” English cheerleader Kelly Smith said of the dancers’ relations with the players. “We help them win the games in a way, we should be able to meet and interact with them,” added the 24-year-old, one of a dozen women in the Delhi Capitals cheerleaders team. While a metal fence separates the women from fans in stadiums, they still get trolled online. And the sexist jibes from the crowd can be daunting. Charlie Chaeppela said someone created a fake social media account to taunt her. “They used a picture of me while I was cheerleading, they threatened me and asked me why I was in India,” she said.
