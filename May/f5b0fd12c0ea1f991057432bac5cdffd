Two MPs yesterday dismissed Deputy President William Ruto’s opponents, saying they were noise makers who would not succeed in their mission. Bomet Woman Rep Joyce Korir and Konoin MP Brighton Yegon  said those scheming against the DP were spreading cheap propaganda to gain political mileage. Speaking at a funeral in Boito village, Bomet county on Saturday, the MPs urged Jubilee supporters to ignore the anti-Ruto campaigns. “As far as we know, Ruto is on course to succeed President Kenyatta when he retires in 2022 and those thinking otherwise are out of touch with the country’s politics. They are just spoilers who have lost direction,” said Korir. They accused Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) secretary general Francis Atwoli and Team Kieleweke of trying to paint Ruto in bad light to prevent him from ascending to the presidency.
