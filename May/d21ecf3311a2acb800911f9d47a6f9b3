Dutch national carrier KLM celebrates its presence in the East African region as it marks half a century since it started flying to Kenya. “Since KLM started flying into Kenya fifty years ago, we have become a major player in the regional aviation market. Together with our strategic partner Kenya Airways we plan to further strengthen our presence in the region in the coming years” said Mr. Arthur Dieffenthaler, Air France KLM General Manager for East Africa. Mr. Dieffenthaler was speaking at the Villa Rosa Kempinski, Nairobi, where the airline hosted its customers and partners at a dinner ceremony to celebrate its 50thanniversary of flying to Kenya. “At KLM customers are at the heart of our service. We continue to invest in our customers. We invest in new fleet, in full flat business class seats and have just opened a brand new lounge at Schiphol Airport, all to ensure that our customers can travel comfortably. We thank all our customers for their loyalty,” said Mr. Dieffenthaler. The event was attended by senior government officials, customers and key partners and comes ahead of the global 100th anniversary of KLM in October. KLM is the oldest airline in the world still operating under its original name. It has been celebrating its customers and partners in the region with a campaign dubbed 50 Years of Beautiful connections. Mr. Dieffenthaler also thanked all the key partners for their continued support. “Our primary role as an airline is to provide the all-important air connectivity between the region and the rest of the world thus promoting sustainable tourism and development. We thank Kenya for the warm welcome 50 years ago and the hospitality ever since. We are looking forward to the next 50 years together,” he added.
