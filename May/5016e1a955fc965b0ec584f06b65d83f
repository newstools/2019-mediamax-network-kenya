A multi-agency investigative team was yesterday put on the spot after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji withdrew criminal charges against a Moroccan company and its directors for importation of reportedly toxic fertiliser. According to a plea agreement adopted in court and ultimately freed suspects namely OCP (K) Ltd, its directors Malika Karama and Younes Addou and Benson Oduor Ngesa, a Clearing Agent Bollore Transport and Karimi Lofti Senhadji shows that the DPP made the decision without “the full benefit of factual scenario being provided to the investigators.” New facts Haji through his assistant Alexander Muteti told the trial Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot the investigators had not heard four of the accused persons before the decision was made because they were out of jurisdiction adding that the agreement was made after new facts were availed to them. The agreement, however, does not affect Kenya Bureau of Standards boss Ongwae and his six co-accused criminal case.
