London, Wednesday The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared the first glimpse of their newborn son. Introducing the child, who was wrapped in a white shawl, Meghan said: “He has the sweetest temperament, he’s really calm. He’s been the dream.” As they both laughed, Prince Harry said: “I don’t know who he gets that from.” The couple confirmed they will introduce the Queen to her eighth and newest great-grandchild later on. Talking about their first few days as parents, Meghan said: “It’s magic, it’s pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I’m really happy.” “It’s great. Parenting is amazing. “It’s only been two and a half days, but we’re just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy,” he added. On which parent the baby resembled more, Harry said: “Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks. “We’re basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.” Later, asked to show more of their son’s face, Meghan laughed as Harry joked: “He’s already got a little bit of facial hair as well, wonderful.”                                            – BBC
