Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka A parliamentary session to deliberate a proposed takeover bid of a terminal by the Kenya National Shipping Line from the Kenya Ports Authority ended prematurely yesterday. This is after Members of the National Assembly committee on Transport turned away Shipping and Maritime Affairs principal secretary Nancy Karigithu. The David Pkosing-led committee sent the PS away after establishing the parastatal does not fall under her docket. The team said they will invite Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia and PS Esther Koimett next Thursday. On Tuesday, MPs Owen Baya (Kilifi North) and Zuleikha Hassan (Kwale Woman Rep) joined leaders from the region to reject the planned takeover bid through what they termed “backdoor”. At the session, the PS revealed that the shipping agency was hived off her docket and transferred to the State department of Transport through an Executive Order in 2016.
