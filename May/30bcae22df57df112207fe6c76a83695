Adalla Allan How did you get the car? I bought the ride from a friend of mine, also a car lover. Why did you go for this car? This has always been my dream car ever since I developed the love for sports cars. It is much sleeker, faster and overall better than any Subaru STi What does the car do for you? I love driving it everywhere, racing it and showcasing it during motor-shows. But the absolute best thing about it is carving corners on a smooth road. Nothing beats that. Where was your first road trip with the car? Great run 9 with my buddies. It was the best trip ever. We visited a children’s home in Subukia that cares for intellectually challenged kids. Combining charity and driving was perfect. The route we took was Nairobi-Flyover-Engineer-Olkalou-Dundori-Nakuru-Subukia-Nyahururu-Nyeri-Nairobi, an unforgettable road trip in more ways than one. What is the best thing about this car? Any drive in this car, the performance and its the gnarly sounds from the exhaust always put a smile on my face. Any modifications? I rebuilt the engine myself using forged parts to make sure that it could handle additional power after modifications, these included upgraded bolt-on parts, a replacement turbo and tuning by your’s truly. What are some of the drawbacks about this car? Let’s just say a modding lifestyle is very expensive. It’s a costly passion this. Did you know! The Mitsubishi Evolution won the European Hill Climb Championship 10 times since 2007, with 9 wins also in the FIA International Hill Climb Cup.
