Amos Abuga @AMOKC1oo1 Men’s national volleyball team head coach Moses Epoloto had warned against complacency as he takes the players through the paces ahead of the June 5-10 CAVB Zone V All Africa Games qualifiers at Kasarani Gymnasium. At stake during the six-day qualifying tournament is a ticket to the All African Games in Morocco in August.  Eight teams will take part in the tourney. The host will have to wade challenge from Rwanda, Uganda and Egypt, if they are to match the fate of two years ago when they lifted the title in Kigali, Rwanda. The veteran tactician who named the team last week says no place is guaranteed in the squad further urging the players to up their game as the team commences second week of training at the Kasarani Indoor facility. Return from injury As of yesterday, the defending champions were boosted with the return from injury of key players in Abiud Kipkirui, Noah Bett and Cornelius Kiplagat all from General Service Unit (GSU). The players will be crucial for the team. “I am happy to have the trio back to the team, having them in great shape is not only good for their individual careers but the team generally,” he added. “From the word go, each of the players is well aware no place in the team is reserved for anyone, what I demand is the players to show me that they deserve to be in the team,” said the coach. Epoloto says the bare minimum of the national team is to win a medal during the All Africa Games in Morocco. “I am impressed that the newcomers in the squad are getting the regulars out of the comfort zone. That is very encouraging because it makes the team formidable,” he added.
