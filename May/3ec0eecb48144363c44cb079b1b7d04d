People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  (Peta) Asia, an affiliate of Peta US, released a video of workers at the Naivasha slaughterhouse beating the donkeys that are crammed in a corner.  The traders slaughter the animals for their skins usually used to make energy drinks, candy and traditional medicine called ejiao. “While slaughterhouses cash in on the Chinese desire for ejiao, gentle donkeys are paying the price by being tortured and killed,” says Peta vice-president Jason Baker. He said ejiao industry, which produces 5,000 tonnes of products annually, uses some four million donkey hides each year, half of which are imported to China from other countries, including Kenya. “Kenya has opened three new donkey slaughterhouses in the last three years alone,” he added.
