Gatanga MP Joseph Nduati has urged the government to control the debts it is incurring to cushion the country’s economy. He acknowledged the need to borrow money for various development projects but cautioned that the huge debts could make it impossible for the country to undertake other projects if collected revenue will be used to repay the debts. “I urge the President to start strategising on how to repay the  debts incurred because they will make  it impossible to use our own resources to develop the country,” he said. Nduati said borrowing has been necessitated by clamour for development to improve peoples’ livelihoods.He, however, called for proper utilisation of resources in implementing development projects. He said MPs have agreed to hold talks with the National Treasury to come up with strategies on how to manage the debts. At the same time, Nduati said  leaders who do not support President Uhuru  Kenyatta are not welcome to politic in Murang’a county. He said the county, which is part of the larger Mt Kenya region, is the backyard of the President and it is where he should enjoy the greatest support. The MP said over the last few months, the county has been turned into a political field with two factions (Team Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga) giving diverse opinions on 2022 succession politics. He expressed concern that the meetings are propagating  divisive politics, which could affect the stability of the region. Nduati accused the Tanga Tanga team, affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto, of going against the president’s directive to stop succession campaigns. “The president has made it clear that he wants leaders to focus on development and we should abide by that,” he said.
