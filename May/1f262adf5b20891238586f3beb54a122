Moscow, Monday A Russian passenger plane erupted in a huge ball of fire and black smoke after making an emergency landing at Moscow’s busiest airport, killing 41 people including at least two children. Dramatic footage that went viral on social media showed Aeroflot’s Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft crash-landing and then speeding along the runway at Sheremetyevo international airport on Sunday, flames pouring from its fuselage. Passengers could be seen leaping onto an inflatable slide at the front and running from the blazing plane as huge black columns of smoke billowed into the sky. Survivors Investigators said 41 people had died. “There were 78 people including crew members on board the plane,” which was bound for the northwestern city of Murmansk, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. “According to the updated info which the investigation has as of now, 37 people survived.”  Eleven people were injured, Dmitry Matveyev, the Moscow region’s health minister said earlier in the day. Witness Alyona Osokina said she was inside the terminal when she suddenly saw a plane on fire rushing along the runway.                        – AFP
