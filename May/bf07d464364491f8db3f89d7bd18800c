Mercy Salisi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Tuesday launched the distribution of more than 1,000 water tanks, with a capacity of 10,000 litres each, to all city wards. Speaking at Mukuru Kayaba, he said he is determined to fulfil his promise of bringing to an end perennial water problems in the county as per his campaign manifesto. “I promised Nairobi residents that I will end water problems, and I am determined to ensure I fulfil this promise,” he said. The governor pledged that in 2019/20 financial year, his government will drill three boreholes in the county’s major slums, including Kibera, Mathare, Mukuru Kwa Reuben, Mukuru Kwa Njenga, Fuata Nyayo, Mariguini and Korogocho. He also pledged to tackle water diversion challenges, saying several people have in the recent past been arrested and charged over the same. Since assuming office in 2017, Sonko said, his administration has ensured 4,468 new water connections, a figure he targets to double in the next financial year. County Water Chief Officer Mohamed Abdi hailed Sonko’s water-for-all campaign, which he said will help to solve the perennial cases of water shortage in the capital city. “We have already advertised for drilling of 20 boreholes across the county, the tender is at the evaluation stage. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company will also award tenders for drilling of 12 other boreholes,” he said. County Water Services director of Mario Kainga said the distribution of the water tanks will begin today in 71 wards before the second phase kicks off  to cover all other wards.  “The water tanks project will help to solve the perennial water problems in informal settlements. Sonko’s administration has allocated Sh5 million for water in each ward,” he said.
