The bonfire crackles in the dark Machakos night, the firewood splinters sending fiery sparks into the ink night sky. I clutch my glass of Grants and Coke, my camp-made tincture of choice, and marvel at just how hospitable nature can be. I am in the thick of Ol Donyo Sabuk, at Beketa Holiday Camp. Don Wambua and June, the proprietors, are big on making sure the visitors feel at home. Dinner was a lovely affair that consisted of wet fry goat and chicken with either rice, ugali or chapati. Our stomachs are well lined, ready for the liquid fire. Our hosts regale us with hearty tales of laughing hyenas, springhares and Lord Macmillan, all accounts related to the park. I take more Grants. I think I spot Orion in the night sky. There is a half moon peeking right next to the star constellation. According to Greek mythology Orion could be chasing some Greek slay queens or running from the scorpion which could kill him. It all depends on where you are looking at it from. I wonder if there are any African tales that explain star constellations. Why don’t we have an African star up there in the night sky, installed not by Zeus but by an African Deity? I wonder if Grants and I should part so I can better appreciate Orion. I wonder who I would install in the sky if I was the said Deity. I decide to say bye to my Grants and walk off to my room with glass walls and a clear view of the night sky and Orion’s chase. Or run. It does not really matter. At least not here and now. I will continue musing, as well as this food and drink cycle, tomorrow.
