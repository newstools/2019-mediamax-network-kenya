By Nancy Gitonga The High Court Friday released 38 Kenya Revenue Authority employees held over tax evasion on a cash bail of Sh200,000 each. Justice Luka Kimaru released the suspects on bail on condition they should be appearing before the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at 10am daily until the probe into the matter is concluded. This is after the suspects moved to the High Court challenging their detention following a ruling on Monday by senior resident magistrate Paul Mayova that they remain in custody for two weeks as detectives probe the tax evasion scandal. Through lawyer Tom Ojienda the suspects said by virtue of their arrest, they are on interdiction and cannot possibly visit the employer who is the KRA, or interfere with any witnesses for investigations. They further said they are willing to cooperate with the police and respond to any query as directed by the court.
In an affidavit by Inspector Arthur Onyango, he informed the court that investigations into the matter are complex and require detailed analysis in respect to over 178 mobile phone numbers and M-Pesa statements. The court heard that offences the DCI is investigating include money laundering, tax evasion, abuse of office, and neglect of duty. The case will be mentioned on May 22.
