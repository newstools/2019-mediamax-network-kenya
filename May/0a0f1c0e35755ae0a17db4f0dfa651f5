By PD Reporter The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) will this year hold its annual FSC Africa members meeting in Nairobi, with the convention further expected to discuss a special session being dedicated to tropical forestry. The forum is slated for 13 to 18 May and will host members of the economic, social and environmental chambers along with stakeholders including a delegation of WWF International and environmental and conservation researchers. The organizers say the convention will provide stronger partnerships in the adoption of national standards for FSC-certification as well as promote certification of natural forests. “One of the aims of the meeting is to create stronger local partnerships in Kenya and East Africa to develop the adoption of national standards for FSC-certification and promote certification of natural forests, improve management of existing certified plantations and identify ways to enhance FSC-certified smallholders,” said Kim Carstensen, Director General of FSC and Harrison Kojwang, FSC Africa regional Director, who will both preside over the event. FSC is also keen to drive market forces in the region to encourage them to sustainable sourcing of forest products as a mechanism to promote sustainability and facilitate access to international markets. The convention will also seek to discuss a continent-wide strategy to enhance FSC’s mission as a global reference in responsible forest management and increase its capacity to achieve its goals in a region that is crucial for the long-term survival of forests. The organization is also holding a Tropical Forestry meeting to dis-cuss and seek long-term solutions to the specific issues related to the management and certification of tropical rain forests, with a focus on the Congo Basin.
