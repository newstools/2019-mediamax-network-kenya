Nyamira County Referral Hospital and Keroka sub-county hospital are yet to instal theatre and renal machines under the leased medical equipment programme. Nyamira County Executive Committee member in charge of Health Services Douglas Bosire said the equipment has not been installed because the National government is yet to allocate funds for the construction of facilities to house the equipment. County director of Health services Jack Magara said installation of theatre equipment has not been done in two health facilities because the National government has not allocated funds for the completion of the theatre rooms. Magara confirmed that at Manga and Gesima sub-county hospitals, the equipment have been installed and are in full operation. Four health facilities in Nyamira county benefited from health equipment scheme.Â They are Nyamira County Referral Hospital and Keroka, Gesima and Manga sub-county hospitals.
