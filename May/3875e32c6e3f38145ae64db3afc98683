Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Governors have called on the  National Treasury to stop further payment and deductions for the controversial medical equipment lease scheme to the 47 counties. Instead, the county chiefs recommend that the funds be channelled directly to the county governments so as to be captured locally through their budgets because the health facilities are under the jurisdiction of the county governments. “The managed Equipment Services experience has shown not all counties received all the equipment yet all the counties are paying amounts annually,” the Council of Governors said in its advisory letter to the National Treasury. Senate report Their calls come days after the Senate sided with governors and recommended in its report on the 2019 Budget Policy Statement that allocation for the leasing of medical equipment in the division of revenue bill, 2019  be suspended. “The number of health visits for both outpatient and inpatient increased by 1.5 million persons in 2017 as reported by the statistical abstract 2018. There is, therefore, need for consideration for an increment based on the increased cost of provision of services,” CoG said in a submission signed by chairman Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) to Senate Finance and Budget committee.
