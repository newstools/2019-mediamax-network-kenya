Impala Saracens pipped Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) 11-10 in a nervy Enterprise Cup 15-aside semi-finals at Impala Club, with the hosts romping to the finals against hard-hitting Kabras. Head coach Frank Ndong savoured a priceless half pitch penalty kick by fullback Antony Odhiambo to go a point over KCB for the win. The Sarries finally got it right, revenging a 25-3 Kenya Cup loss to the bankers in their previous encounter where a faulty second half fight saw them concede all the 25 points whilst managing a sole penalty. “It was a tough match, their defence was solid but we managed to get some points from the few attacks we made. Our defensive awareness today was focused and made very few errors so we managed to contain and shut their attacking continuity and offloads,” said Ndong who returns to the cup final seeking the trophy they lost 21-3 to Homeboyz last season. At RFUEA Grounds, Kabras head coach Henley Du Plessis was encouraged by his boys eight-try performance which leaves them in a position of contesting for the Enterprise Cup final and home Kenya Cup semi-final against Mwamba for a historic home final against the winner between KCB and Kenya Harlequins as their ransom. Du Plessis’ charges restricted Harlequins to just a try and a penalty while posting a solid 54 points for an unpredicted 54-11 outcome. “The return of our sevens players had impact today, there was a positive mood and focus even before the match and we played the way we wanted to play, exploited their mistakes and got the results we wanted ” said Du Plessis who lays in wait for Mwamba on May 11 Kenya Cup semis and Impala on May 18 Enterprise Cup finals. Fijian Jone Kubu opened the scores with a try converted by Ugandan international Philip Wokorach. Kenya Simbas International George Nyambua, Ugandan international Daudi Ssemwami, skipper Max Adaka and South African Mario Wilson scored a try each to head to the break with a 26-8 lead but down to 14 men after Jone Kubu was sent to the bin.
