Irene Githinji @gitshee The Government is gearing up for the second phase of the Digital Literacy Programme expected to be rolled out in July. Under Phase Two, themed “Using to Learn”, the government wants learners to use technology to formulate concepts for learning and enhance creativity and innovation. A statement from the Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) indicated that the project will entail setting up a shared digital learning resource centre in schools with appropriate infrastructure and tools. “The programme is targeting learners in all public primary schools and is aimed at integrating the use of digital technologies in learning. The decision was borne out of the vision and context that technology now defines our world and there is need to prepare young people for today’s realities,” read the statement. Only Moi University, Jomo Kenya University of Agriculture Technology (Jkuat) and Dedan Kimathi have local assembly plants for the digital literacy devices. The Senate’s committee on ICT and the National Assembly’s ICT team are today expected to tour Moi University, Eldoret, together with ICT Principal secretary Jerome Ochieng’ to assess readiness of the institution to roll out the DLP Phase Two. The ministry will later on implement Phase Three, themed “Using to Produce’’, whose objective is to use  technology for employment creation and to mentor learners for development. During this phase, advanced labs with tools to enable designing and prototyping of products will be set up.  The Phase One Programme themed “Learning to Use” sought to expose learners to friendly technology and encourage its early adoption. Public primary schools received various types of devices. Earlier in the year, Education Principal secretary Belio Kipsang said setting up local assembly plants was in line with the Big Four agenda.
