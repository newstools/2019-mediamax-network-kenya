Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri has defended politicians who give monetary donations to the Church and the needy. He said some leaders should not demonise people who are helping the Church and the needy in the society, adding that giving is an integral part of religion. The MP took issue with Opposition chief Raila Odinga, whom he accused of politicising harambees for political mileage. Raila has been quoted on several occasions claiming that corrupt politicians could be using the church to sanitise their loot. “I don’t think it is wrong for politicians to give money or any gift to the Church as long as the money they are giving is not dirty,” he said. Ngunjiri said many churches have been able to implement projects because of harambees stressing the need for leaders to give back to the society. The legislator also took issue with Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, who he accused of being the face of hypocrisy. He claimed that Atwoli has been bragging about his wealth without helping needy Kenyans. Speaking at Kameruri farm in Bahati where he handed over seedlings to a 78-year-old granny, Ngunjiri said it was unfortunate that Atwoli could brag about a Sh5 million gold watch. “It is so unfortunate that leaders are being self-centred,” he said. Nominated MCA Grace Wambui hailed the community’s efforts to help the less fortunate saying it will go a long way in improving the society’s welfare and relations.
