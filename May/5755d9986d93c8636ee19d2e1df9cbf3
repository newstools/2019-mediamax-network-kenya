Millers and processors will start buying maize from the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) next week, Ministry of Agriculture and irrigation confirms. Crops Development Principal secretary Hamadi Boga yesterday confirmed to Business Hub that NCPB and the Strategic Food Reserve Oversight Board (SFR) will advertise in local dailies seeking buyers of the declared stock of 3.5 million bags of maize. “Even though we agreed last week to release maize into the market to stabilise prices, the process has to be done formally and as per the procurement laws. On May 14, the two institutions will advertise in the local dailies the sale of 3.5 million bags to millers. Millers and processors will be required to follow the due process when applying,” said Boga. Head of SFR secretariat Omar Haji Salat told Business Hub that the Cabinet in January had directed the board to release two million bags from the previous stocks in a move aimed at freeing up space for the purchase of last season’s crop. Unga production Salat said the maize would be sold at Sh1,600 for maize flour production and Sh1, 400 for animal feeds manufacturing. With the addition of 1.5 million bags to the previous approved stock, Salat confirmed that the stock has to be approved by the Cabinet. Last week Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri, millers and processors and technical officers from the ministry agreed that to stabilise the skyrocketing prices of maize flour in the market there is need to release 3.5 million bags of white maize. The minister further agreed with the manufacturers of animal feeds that they will receive 300,000 bags which is part of the 3.5 million bags. Even though the quantity to be released may not fully tame the current crisis, SFR says that the stock will help in easing maize flour prices from the current Sh117 and Sh120 for a 2-kilogramme packet to below Sh100. The maize will be sold to the millers at Sh2,300.
