Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The Law Society of Kenya’s (LSK) election of the male representative to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) will go on as planned after the High Court dismissed a suit seeking to stop the exercise. Lawyer Mark Ndung’u Ndumia had filed the suit against LSK Council saying it failed to comply with Chapter Six of the Constitution by lowering the bar below the bare minimum acceptable levels in any respectable association, which would invite anarchy. He claimed that the council cleared ineligible candidates for male representative to the JSC. Justice James Makau dismissed the suit saying the court-lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. makau noted that the Law Society of Kenya Act and its subsidiary legislation, the Law Society of Kenya Arbitration Regulation 1997 regulate such disputes between members. “The dispute herein ought to have been referred to arbitration instead of moving to this court without complying with the Law Society constitution. The fact that the petition raises serious issues alone does not give this court jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter,” he ruled. In his suit papers,  Ndumia claimed that the findings by an independent committee had noted that Prof Tom Ojienda and Irungu Gathii were ineligible.
