George Kebaso @Morarak More factories, hotels, and health facilities face closure following fresh announcement of investigations jointly by the National Environment Management Authority and County Government of Nairobi to ascertain  source of dumping in the Nairobi River. Others whose operating licences face revocation include private garbage collectors who have been cited as some of the contributors to tonnes of domestic waste being retrieved from the river. This announcement was made yesterday in Dandora and Korogocho as agencies carrying out the cleaning exercise of the river encountered new challenges they claim are slowing down the ongoing work. Speaking at Korogocho fresh produce market yesterday, Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu said  already 25 factories that are discharging raw effluent into the river and its tributaries have been shut down. “As we speak here, this afternoon we are shutting three more factories that are illegally discharging waste into the river,” he said. He said the 25 industries do not meet the authority’s standards of treatment and discharge of waste water.
