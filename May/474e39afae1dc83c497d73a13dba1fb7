Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho yesterday waived medical bills for 60 patients, who had been detained at the Coast Provincial General Hospital. The waiver was a Labour Day gift to the patients, some who have been at the facility for months. County Health executive Hazel Koitaba said the beneficiaries of the waiver were suffering from terminal illnesses. “As a good gesture, the Governor has directed the hospital to cover the cost of treatment for the patients. I am, therefore, ordering the release of the 60 patients,” she said. Kadzo Saumu, whose relative had accrued a Sh300,000 bill over a period of seven months, thanked Joho for the kind gesture.
