Amos Abuga Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai hosted former Olympic and World 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop at the National Police Service (NPS) headquarters on Tuesday, reiterating that the athlete is a hero who should not be forgotten. With a hashtag #NewDawn, NPS tweeted: “Chief Inspector Asbel Kiprop is our hero. We must never forget him.” The meeting comes after People Daily ran an article yesterday that Athletics Kenya, NPS and the athlete’s family members had joined efforts to aid the athlete who has been on a social media meltdown since the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) handed him a four-year ban for a doping violation after being found to have used banned blood booster Erythropoietin (EPO) in an out-of-competition test in Iten in November 2017. The 2008 Beijing Olympics 1,500m champion, took to Twitter at the weekend to vent his frustrations and anger, daring his NPS to sack him and withdraw his firearm before he uses it to “earn justice”. The comments drew fear and sympathy from his family, friends and fans, leading to sustained efforts to reach out to him in an effort to find what could be the problem.
