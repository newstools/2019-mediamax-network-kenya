In a report tabled in the National Assembly, Auditor General Edward Ouko raised concern over irregular payment of Sh691.5 million that Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission incurred on catering services. According to Ouko (pictured), contracts for the provision of catering services were awarded to the service providers based on predetermined rates issued from the commission’s headquarters which was in complete disregard to Article 227 (1) of the Constitution which requires fairness and transparency in procurement.
