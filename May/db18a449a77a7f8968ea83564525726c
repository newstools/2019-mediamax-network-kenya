PD team @PeopleDailyKe Thirty-two million Kenyans out of the targeted 40 million have registered for the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS) commonly known as Huduma Namba. The revelation came as Kenyans made a last-minute attempt to register for the Huduma Namba. Newly appointed government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna urged Kenyans to rush and enlist on the system ahead of the end of the mass registration exercise tomorrow. Speaking when he made his maiden speech after taking from his predecessor Erick Kiraithe, the retired colonel exuded confidence NIIMS will help curb financial frauds. “NIIMS will significantly reduce identity theft and make financial and property transaction more secure. Kenya has therefore joined very few countries that have done this,” he said adding  that  Huduma Namba will go a long way in achieving the government’s goal of a complete digital economic transformation.  The centralised database generated aims to ease service delivery to Kenyans seeking government related services and even private transactions.” The former army spokesperson said he has officially resigned from the military and will focus on his new assignment.
