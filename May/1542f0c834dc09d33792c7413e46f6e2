Enock Amukhale and Baraka Karama @PeopleDailyKe Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged Orange Democratic Movement party leader Raila Odinga to wake up from the political honeymoon with President Uhuru Kenyatta and fight corruption. Mudavadi said the newfound unity between the two leaders has made it difficult for Raila to tell the President to his face his weaknesses in fighting the vice. “Raila is well known for taking issues head on, he has all of a sudden gone mute and things are not good. I urge him to be what he has always been and lead the fight against the menace,” he said. He said President Uhuru has the political goodwill  to fight  the vice but cautioned him not to take too much time before cracking the whip. “ You only have this year to act or else it will reach a point where you cannot handle the corruption cartels in this country so you better act before it’s too late,” he said. On the sugar sector woes, Mudavadi said only a commission of inquiry will be able to nail cartels behind bringing down sugar industry in the country. Speaking in Gem and Kisumu Central constituencies, Mudavadi said the commission of inquiry has powers to summon the suspects and recommend for their prosecution than the taskforce which only collect views from the public.
