Construction of Kimugu Water Treatment Plant in the outskirts of Kericho town has started in earnest. The Sh1.2 billion water project will be completed in the next two years and will enhance water supply to Kericho town and its environs. Governor Paul Chepkwony has asked the contractor to deliver quality work and complete it within the set  period to address water problems in the area. “We’re working to ensure residents get clean piped water in their homes,” he said in his office on Monday. He called for enhanced conservation efforts and asked those who have planted eucalyptus trees near water sources to cut them down and replace them with indigenous trees. At the same time, Chepkwony yesterday said his administration will not condone corrupt public servants. Speaking yesterday at the county headquarters in Kericho town during the swearing in of eight members of Litein Town Municipal Board, he warned that those found engaging in corruption would be sacked and asked to return the stolen public goods.
