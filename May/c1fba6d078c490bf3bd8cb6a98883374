Omdourmanx, Wednesday Sudan’s main opposition leader today warned protest leaders against any provocation of the country’s army rulers, saying they will soon hand power to a civilian administration as demanded by demonstrators. “We shouldn’t provoke the army council by trying to deprive them of their legitimacy, by depriving them of their positive role in the revolution,” National Umma Party chief Sadiq al-Mahdi said. “We must not challenge them in a way that makes it necessary for them to assert themselves in a different way,” the veteran politician said. Mahdi’s elected government was toppled by now deposed president Omar al-Bashir in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989. Since then Mahdi has fought Bashir politically, and in January threw his weight behind the protest movement that finally saw the army oust Bashir on April 11. But since then the army has resisted transferring power to a civilian government as demanded by the protesters, who have camped in their thousands outside the army’s Khartoum headquarters in a round-the-clock sit-in.      – AFP
