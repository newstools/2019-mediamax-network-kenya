Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has ordered the promotion of junior police officers, who have stayed in one rank for more than 10 years. “I have ordered that those who have stayed in one rank for more than 10 years and have no disciplinary cases be considered urgently,” he said. The police boss on Saturday also directed that Kilimani head of Directorate of Criminal Investigations Fatuma Hadi be promoted, for her exemplary work. “We have to appreciate good work,” he said. Mutyambai spoke during a Flying Squad party in Nairobi, which was also attended by DCI boss George Kinoti. The National Police Service Commission also plans to promote over 500 police constables aged above 50, who have maintained a clean disciplinary record, in a move to tackle stagnation. The exercise is part of the objectives the new commission plans to achieve in its first 100 days.
