Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Malkia Strikers new Italian coach Shailene Ramdoo believes Kenya has what it takes to return to the Olympics after a 15-year wait. Ramdoo, a certified international volleyball trainer with an FIVB Level 2 and 3-course certificate coupled with a UK National Sports Coaching badge, was recommended to Kenya by International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) to help head coach Japeth Munala and the country achieve its ambitions. And after his first training session on Monday, the Italian is impressed. “Kenya cannot complain because of lack of talent. I am impressed with what I have seen today. I see players who have the potential of reaching top levels,” he said. Tough qualifiers He added: “We have to embrace change and accept that the game is constantly evolving more so scientifically and therefore have to position ourselves towards that direction, otherwise the country will be left out.” Kenya last featured in the Olympics during the 2004 edition in Athens, Greece and have missed out in 2008, 2012 and 2016, making qualification for 2020 in Tokyo a must. To do that, they have to navigate past a tough qualifying phase against some of Africa’s best in August. However, Ramdoo and Munala’s immediate task is the Africa Zone Five All African Games qualifiers set to take place from May 18-24 at Lugogo Indoor Arena in Kamapla, Uganda for a chance to feature at the continental event in Morocco in August. “We cannot run away from the fact that Cameroon is one of the teams in the continent that are scaling up so fast and recently we have not been able to match them. It is ironical since previously, our biggest challenge was North Africa but we have to embrace the new dynamics and work to redeem ourselves,” said Munala.
