Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki has raised the red flag over a rogue syndicate of health workers and external players issuing fake Yellow Fever cards to unsuspecting travellers. Kariuki said the cartel is thriving through conduits seeking to profiteer from fees charged thus exposing the country to serious health risks that can cause national security threats. Beginning next month, the CS said, the government will gazette new guidelines regulating the administration of the Yellow Fever vaccination and the centres where the service will be offered. Subsidise jab cost To discourage the vice, Kariuki said her ministry will make the service highly subsidised to eliminate the monetary incentive the crooks are targeting at the expense of innocent people. “This is our country and we love it but we must say the truth. There are crooks issuing Yellow Fever cards from River Road which poses a serious exposure of health risks in our country. Next month, I will be gazetting new guidelines on the issuance of Yellow Fever cards. We will make it almost zero in terms of cost to remove incentives from these crooks,” she said. She spoke during the official opening of a two-day seminar dubbed ‘Health and Security Conference” bringing together medical experts and the Kenyan military, Kenya Defence Forces, at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS) in Nairobi. Those who attended included Defence Cabinet secretary Raychelle Omamo, who said: “No country can reach a state of complete security without collaboration at region.al and international level. Due to weaponisation of pathogens and bacteria either for research or evil deeds, we have to fundamentally re-order how we think about security.”
