Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang, however, said the disciplinary process should be fair but firm. To this end, the PS has issued a circular to regional directors of education and county directors of education directing them to ensure discipline is maintained in schools. He said all schools should convene a meeting of boards of management to deliberate on practical ways of handling discipline challenges. The PS directed principals to work with Interior ministry officials to ensure institutions of learning are secure at all times. “All cases of mass indiscipline should be reported immediately to the county education boards. Schools should ensure open channels of communication to allow students to air their grievances,”said Kipsang.
