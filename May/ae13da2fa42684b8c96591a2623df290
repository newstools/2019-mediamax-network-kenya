Tehran, Wednesday Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal, it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran’s economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal — France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK — of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act.  Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it.  This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran’s civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. Iran’s announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region. – BBC
