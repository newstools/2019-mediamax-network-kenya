ROY LUMBE After a few months of truce between the two warring Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) factions one headed by the outgoing association president John Kameta and the other by Isaac Mbote, the two are at loggerheads again. Mbote wants to be recognized as the interim Secretary General of the association after the Sports Dispute Tribunal ruled that he was to replace Paul Mung’ori of Kenya Defence Forces Boxing Association as the bona fide Secretary General. According to Mbote, Kameta should adhere to the Tribunal’s decision which revoked Mung’ori’s appointment saying he is the genuine holder of the position until elections are held on May 28. “The BAK president and the entire council should respect the descion by the Tribunal where it declared the meetings held to appoint the self proclaimed Secretary General as null and void. I am still the substantive holder of the office,” said Mbote. He has assured the boxing fraternity that elections will be held in accordance with the law saying County Associations including Kenya Police and Busia branch have passed a resolution to hold the long awaited Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) elections at Kasarani’s Moi International Sports Center on May 28. Mbote relies on a November 6, 2018 Sports Dispute Tribunal ruling which declared all meetings held after the expiry of the Association’s May 2017 mandate null and void. The ruling also dismissed the earlier planned November 2018 polls and ordered BAK to hold elections within 60 days. Mombasa branch had sought legal redress against BAK last year on grounds of discrimination which later informed the Tribunal ruling. The September 24 Council Meeting at Kaloleni Social Hall amended the BAK constitution where executive committee members were denied the right to vote during the elections.
