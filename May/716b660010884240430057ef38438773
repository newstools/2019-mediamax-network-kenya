Caracas, Wednesday Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó called for huge May Day protests today to pile pressure on President Nicolas Maduro as the United States said it was prepared to take military action to stem the crisis in the South American nation. Pro- and anti-government rallies were due to take place, a day after violent clashes erupted in the capital following Guaidó’s call on the military to rise up against Maduro, who claimed the insurrection had failed. Guaidó said Wednesday’s opposition rally would be “the biggest in the history of Venezuela” as he presses his attempt to unseat the president.“Across all of Venezuela, we will be in the streets,” said the National Assembly leader, recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, as he repeated his call for the armed forces to join “Operation Freedom” to overthrow the socialist president. Maduro remained defiant, claiming late Tuesday he had defeated an attempted coup. Maduro, who is also due to lead a May Day rally in Caracas, congratulated the armed forces for having “defeated this small group that intended to spread violence through putschist skirmishes.” “This will not go unpunished,” Maduro said in an address broadcast on television and radio. “(Prosecutors) will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned however that US President Donald Trump is adamant the possibility of a military intervention in the South American nation is not simple bluster. “The president has been crystal clear and incredibly consistent. Military action is possible. If that’s what’s required, that’s what the United States will do,” Pompeo told Fox Business Network. – AFP
