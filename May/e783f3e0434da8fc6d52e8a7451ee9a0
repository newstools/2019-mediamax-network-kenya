A Kabarnet court has fined a former land registrar at Baringo Central land offices Sh1 million or one year imprisonment for  fraud and abuse of office. Augustine Koros was charged that he committed the offences on diverse dates between April 4,1997 and September 1,1997, while still in the Public Service as Land Registrar. The court heard that the accused colluded with the late Reuben Cheruiyot to illegally reproduce a title deed without the consent of the original landowner Mark Chemjor who had assisted Cheruiyot with the document to secure a bank loan. The magistrate said the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and handed the suspect  a 10-year jail term. However, the accused who had pleaded not guilty, in mitigation prayed for leniency claiming  he was a widower and that his two wives died leaving him with 14 children with the youngest in Class Two. Forgiveness plea He had also pleaded with the court for forgiveness or to allow him to serve a non-custodial sentence so he could take care of the children. It was after considering the mitigation facts that the magistrate reduced the fine to Sh1 million or one-year jail term. -KNA
