Seth Mwaniki @MwanikiM A total of Sh873,280 was stolen from Equity Bank, Karatina, during a daring robbery on Monday evening. The gang struck a few minutes past 7pm after armed police, who man the bank during the day, left. The robbers, who were armed with an AK-47 rifle and machetes, reportedly accessed the bank using a master key of the main double-door leading to the banking hall and found some members of staff, who were preparing to leave. The gang reportedly ordered the bank staff to lie down as they made their way to the strong room where they took the cash. No one was hurt during the incident. Nyeri County Police Commander Adiel Nyange said some bank staff and night shift guards are being held to help police with investigations. He said they have gathered crucial leads that will help in pursuing the robbers.  “I am quite hopeful that we will crack this heist in the shortest time possible going by what we have gathered so far. We will not let criminals get away scot free as innocent people suffer,” he said.
