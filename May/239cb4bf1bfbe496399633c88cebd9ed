Irene Githinji @gitshee Education Principal secretary Belio Kipsang has directed Regional Directors of Education (RDEs) to ensure  entry grades to Teachers Training Colleges (TTC) remain a C (plain). In the circular, Belio directed the RDE’s to liaise with TTC principals for placement of affected students who may wish to transfer to technical training institutes. “You are directed to bring to the attention of all principals of TTCs, both private and public that the entry grades for persons entering TTCs shall remain as prescribed in the Legal Notice No. 50 of 2016,” the PS said. Last month, the High Court ordered entry into consent for parties involved in the row to lower entry grades for TTCs. The parties involved were Teachers Service Commission (TSC), Education ministry, Kenya National Qualifications Authority and the Attorney General. In January, TSC had moved to the High Court to contest a directive the Ministry of Education had issued, requiring entry grades for TTCs be lowered to D+ (plus) from the initial C (plain).
