A Court of Appeal judge has called on the sex age consent to be increased to 21 years. Lady Justice Martha Koome said if the country is to have a debate on consent age, then it should be on increasing it and not to reduce it from 18 to 16 years. Five weeks ago, a three-judge bench, overturned  a 15-year sentence for a man who impregnated a 17-year-old girl. Roselyn Nambuye, Daniel Musinga and Patrick Kiage had justified their ruling  saying prisons were jammed with young men serving lengthy sentences for having had sexually abused adolescent girls whose consent had been held immaterial because they were under 18 years. “It is high time the country considered revision of the Sexual Offences Act,”the three judges said. Speaking during the launch of the Nairobi Children’s Court Service week yesterday, Justice Koome, however, said the children’s voice and opinion should be considered in matters that affect them directly. “We should not be in a hurry to lower the age of sex consent, let us give our children time to grow,” she said. -KNA
