Lynette Matheka @PeopleSport11 Kenya handball women’s national team’s dreams of representing Zone Five at the All Africa Games between August 23 and September 3 in Morocco went up in smoke as the team was disqualified from the qualifiers in Uganda due to late payment of participation fee. The competition was expected to bring together ten nations which included Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Sudan, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and hosts Uganda to fight for a slot to represent the zone at the All Africa games but only Kenya and the hosts turned up. The Kenyan team faced Uganda on Saturday losing 28-24. At the time the regional federation was expecting South Sudan’s team arrival for the tournament to be played on a round robin basis. With South Sudan a no-show in the long run, a return leg was scheduled for Monday at 4pm. “A walkover was handed to Uganda after our participation fee of 900 euros (Sh102,000) was wired late. For us to be allowed to play the first match I had to use my position as the Zone’s Secretary General (SG) to convince the federation that the payment would be done on time,” said Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) fixtures secretary Charles Omondi. “The team was kitted, provided with tickets and accommodation paid for well in time. We knew that money had been channelled to the federation on time and I am yet to establish why the participation fee was paid late. It is a rather unfortunate turn of events and the team is heartbroken,” added Omondi. On his part, national federation SG Nderitu Gikaria says that it took time for the monies to be released by the Sports ministry.
