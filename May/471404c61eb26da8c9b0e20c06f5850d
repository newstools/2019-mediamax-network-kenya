Tanzania giants Yanga have intensified their pursuit of Harambee Stars and Bandari custodian Farook Shikalo as they plan to bolster their side for next season’s campaign. The team, one of the most followed in the continent, is also eyeing the services of Kariobangi Sharks duo, Duke Abuya and Harrison Mwendwa. Yanga coach Zahera Mwinyi told People Sports yesterday that he was interested with the trio and was confident of acquiring their services by the time they are beginning the new season. “I saw the players here in Dar es Salaam during the SportPesa Cup and I was very impressed with them. We have been following their performance keenly and we have already started engaging their clubs for their moves,” Mwinyi who also doubles up as DR Congo national team’s assistant coach said. Yanga who have won the Tanzanian league 27 times are currently on top of the Tanzanian league table on 77 points from 33 matches, five points better than their arch rivals Simba SC, who, however, have five matches at hand. Mwinyi is said to have settled on Abuya and Mwendwa after being frustrated in the pursuit of Gor Mahia’s Rwandese striker Jacquis Tuyisenge who is believed to have demanded for a Sh20.2 million (200,000 dollars) signing fee. The tactician believes that Mwendwa who was picked as a player of match twice during the SportPesa competition, would be an automatic replacement of aging Mrisho Ngasa who returned to the club he first played for in 2006, after joining from Mbeya City at the beginning of the season. Shikalo was the best custodian in the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) last season when he helped Bandari to a second position finish.
