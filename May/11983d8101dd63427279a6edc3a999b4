Mathew Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKe Kiambu Woman Rep Gathoni Wamuchomba has hit out at Tanga Tanga team for ignoring President Uhuru Kenyatta’s call for an end to politicking and instead, focus on development. Speaking at Kiriko village in Gatundu North constituency where she donated food items to Karimenu II dam residents, the MP said  Kenyans are tired of political rhetoric and want to see projects implemented. He told Mount Kenya leaders to rally behind Uhuru and support his development agenda. “Those who don’t deliver on all they promised will have no alternative but to go home after their term. Leaders should stop the noise and concentrate on service delivery. Kenyans are tired,” she said. On 2022 politics, Wamuchomba said anyone seeking to garner votes from the expansive Mt Kenya region and particularly Kiambu county, should first support the current government’s agenda.
