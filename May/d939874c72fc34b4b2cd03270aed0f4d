Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has opposed an application by Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal in which he was seeking unconditional access to his four frozen bank accounts at Kenya Commercial Bank. The anti-graft agency, in an affidavit by Joel Khisa, a forensic investigator with the commission, claims the governor has yet to demonstrate that all the money in the accounts was not acquired illegally. EACC had obtained preservation orders against the governor’s four bank accounts with a total of Sh14.6 million on March 19. Fatally defective The governor moved to the High Court under a certificate of urgency seeking to have said orders discharged  saying the court froze his  salary accounts despite  the funds being obtained through legal and honest business dealings. He claimed he has been unable to access his salary to cater for his personal and family subsistence. In response however, EACC claims the application by the governor is fatally defective and lacking in merit and, therefore, ought to be dismissed.
