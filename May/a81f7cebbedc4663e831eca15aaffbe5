Kiambu  Senator Kimani Wamatangi has told Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu to stop blaming him for his woes. Reacting to claims by the governor that he had played a role in the anomalies in the Kiambu county government’s budget tabled before a Senate committee recently, Wamatangi said he was only playing his role of Senator. “I took an oath to oversight financial activities of county governments, Kiambu included, and it is therefore illogical for Waititu to insinuate that I am targeting him,” Wamatangi said on Tuesday in Githunguri during the launch of free Information Technology classes for unemployed youths. The Senator also challenged governors to moot job-creation initiatives in their counties instead of relying on the national government to address unemployment, which he described as a time bomb. Online jobs One way of achieving that, he said, would be to come up with programmes that would boost small and medium enterprises in the counties. He said the IT training, which targets 1.8 million youths in Kiambu, would help the youth explore opportunities in online businesses and jobs. “The training will equip the youth to jostle in the competitive digital world,” he said.
