Emmanuel Masinde @baromeo Berlin marathon runners-up Amos Kipruto is excited to be selected by Athletics Kenya (AK) to represent Kenya in marathon during the IAAF World Championships slated between September and October in Doha, Qatar. The Kapsabet-based runner is counting on his experience in Berlin, where he recorded 2:06:23, to finish behind champion Eliud Kipchoge who broke the world record after running 2.01.39. “I am very proud to have been selected and to get the opportunity to represent my country at the World Championships in Doha. I believe every professional athlete dreams of wearing the national colours and my dream has come true,” said Kipruto, who also finished second in the 2018 Tokyo marathon behind winner Dickson Chumba. Take a break The runner, who is under 2 Running Club management, will take a break to recover after a poor performance in the Prague marathon where he was placed fourth last month. “I will give myself a short period to refresh my body and mind from Prague Marathon and then dive fully into preparations for the World Championships. I am aware that the marathon in Doha will be very challenging with tough conditions but I am well motivated to take up the challenge,” added Kipruto. Kipruto made a triumphant marathon debut in 2016 when he won in Rome before finishing a disappointing 12th in Amsterdam the same year. In Doha, Kipruto will team up with defending champion Geofrey Kirui, 2018 Paris Marathon winner Paul Lonyangata, Ernest Ngeno and Laban Korir.
