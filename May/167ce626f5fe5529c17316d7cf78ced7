Hull City coaches are in the country to conduct a coaching camp with 10 local tacticians in an initiative aimed at improving football standards in Kenya. The initiative, dubbed ‘Coaches to Count On’ organised by gaming firm SportPesa will entail theory and practical lessons. Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS) is hosting the event, attended by coaches drawn from across the country and will run up to tomorrow. Seven male and three female coaches qualified for the training. The selection was based on qualification of a coaching course offered by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) which has been ongoing since 2016. Nurturing players “We hope to increase the number of qualified coaches at a high-performance standard to send back to the industry. We believe that good coaches are very key in nurturing player talent which then translates into successful teams,” said SportPesa’s Chief Marketing officer Kelvin Twissa. The latest training is the third in a month within Africa, after similar ones were held in South Africa and Tanzania as part of the partnership deals between SportPesa and its football club partners from the United Kingdom. Arsenal coaches were in South Africa from April 8-10 to train local coaches while Southampton tacticians held training sessions in Tanzania last week. Hull City coaches, Daniel O’Keefe and Richard O’Donnell, will lead the training sessions in Nairobi. They are accompanied by Senior Account Executive Luke Hall and Commercial Manager Joe Clutterbrook. SportPesa has since its inception in 2014 held several clinics in collaboration with its football partners Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City where over 50 coaches have been trained on various skills.
