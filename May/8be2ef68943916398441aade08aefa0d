The differences between Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and the Auditor General’s Office over an audit report that revealed loss of funds in the county took centre stage during the county’s annual clean-up exercise in Roysambu constituency on Saturday. Sonko accused Auditor General Edward Ouko’s office of losing credibility, saying some of its staff were encouraging corruption and bribery. He said it is time Ouko reined on rogue officers in his office before his image gets tainted. “I wish to caution the Auditor General that unless he cleans his house, his audits will in future lose credibility,” he said. Sonko said it is a mockery of the audit process if counties with glaring irregular allocations were being given clean bills of health yet his administration “is singled out” as having questionable deals. Speaking at AIPC Church grounds during the exercise, the Governor said he will not relent in the war against corruption. Last week, while appearing before Senate’s County Public Accounts and Investments Committee,  chaired by Mosses Kajwang, Sonko tabled evidence on how one of  the Auditor General’s staff tried to bribe him to write a favourable report.
