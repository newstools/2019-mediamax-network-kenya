Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka A parliamentary committee has summoned Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia to shed more light on the proposed shakeup plan by the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) and the Kenya Airways (KQ). KQ’s bid to take over Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) has  raised questions on just who wants the financially troubled Kenya Airways to be in charge of the country’s largest aviation facility and why. CS Macharia alongside the management of KQ and KAA are expected this morning before the National Assembly’s Transport and Public Works committee to  clarify a possible conflict of interest that will see the national carrier manage six airports and several airstrips. Speaking to People Daily yesterday, committee chairman and Pokot South MP David Pkosing said the two public offices owe Kenyans an explanation on what informed the deal. “We want to scrutinise the proposal on the restructuring plan by KAA and the national carrier. We shall also interrogate the Ministry of Transport on the deal,” he said. The National Assembly Public Investments Account (PIC) last week suspended the proposed takeover of the lucrative airport.  This was after the committee chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir met the KAA managing director Johnny Andersen, among other officials.
