Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu The government has expressed disappointment at the move by US to warn its citizens against travelling to some parts of Kenya over possible terrorist attacks. Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala (pictured) said the announcement has already started inflicting injuries on the now flourishing Kenya’s tourism sector, saying that the action has led to diversion of two cruise ships destined for the Port of Mombasa. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday, the CS accused US embassy of “blowing the DusitD2 attack out of proportion” despite having held a meeting with all embassies and agreed that no travel advisories would be issued against Kenya because the current situation was not a Kenyan problem but a world phenomenon. “I have raised this issue with Foreign Affairs ministry. They have scared away two cruise ships which were Mombasa-bound, forcing them to divert to other destinations,” Balala said. “When we do this it is the common mwananchi that you are hurting. They have brought fear and there is no need for fear in the country. The country is safe and secure.” MS Nautica, one of the Mombasa-bound cruise ship was expected to dock in the coastal city on Sunday morning and stay for more than 10 hours but sailed off to Mahe, Seychelles, following the alert by the US government that Westerners might be targeted in Nairobi, Naivasha, Nanyuki and the coastal areas.
