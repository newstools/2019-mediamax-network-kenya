Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A parliamentary committee was yesterday shocked by revelations that 450 employees of the National Land Commission (NLC) are paid Sh829 million in salaries every year. At a meeting with NLC officials led by vice chair Abigael Mbagaya, the committee heard that staff members take up Sh829 million in emoluments out of the Sh1.2 billion budget for the commission. National Assembly’s Lands Committee chair Rachael Nyamai said it is worrying the commission was spending such a huge amount on remuneration while the development budget was a mere Sh150 million. “Are you telling me that Sh800 million is paid as salaries? This is worrying and we need to get to the bottom of this matter,” said Nyamai. The committee demanded that the commission tables a list of all employees, their designations and the salaries. Mbagaya, however, defended the salaries of the staff and commissioners saying it was set by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). “We are not in any way overpaid. SRC is the one that determines our salaries. In fact, some of our staff feel like they get too little compared to employees of other commissions,” she said. Mbagaya who had appeared the committee to defend the commissions budget, said that despite the limited resources that they had accomplish  a lot. The six-year term of the commission led by embattled chairman Muhammad Swazuri ended yesterday.
