Melechezedeck Ejakait/KNA Sugarcane farmers in Busia county have demanded a thorough vetting of would-be beneficiaries of the Sh2.6 billion issued by the government to clear farmers arrears. Led by a caucus representative Peter Odima, they said it was only through proper vetting that genuine farmers would benefit. They made the demands during a cane growers’ independent assessment forum at Busia Agricultural Training Centre in which they presented a memorandum to Kenya National Alliance of Sugarcane Farmers Organisation (Knasfo). Odima said lists of beneficiaries should be generated through the chiefs’ offices for identification of genuine farmers who delivered sugar cane to government millers. “We want a proper audit of legit farmers owed by government millers. We would like to scrutinise the list from the sub-location level in order to avoid instances of millers’ staff colluding with cartels to siphon farmers’ money through fake entrants,” said Odima. Knasfo interim chairman Saulo Busolo said they will look into the issues the farmers had raised and forward the report to the government. During last year’s Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kakamega county, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the Ministry of Agriculture and Treasury to put in place a framework to audit and pay sugarcane farmers Sh2.6 billion arrears owed by public sugar factories.
