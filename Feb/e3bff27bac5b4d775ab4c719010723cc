Despite the spirited efforts to curb Female Genital Mutilation(FGM) in the country, some of the practicing communities have now come up with ways of practicing the same while evading the arm of the law. The communities have now opted for cross border FGM, where young girls are sneaked into Tanzania for the rite before they are brought back into the country. In a bid to fight the cross border FGM, local elders from villages close to the Tanzanian and Kenyan border have come together and made a declaration to protect the young girls known as the Loita declaration.
