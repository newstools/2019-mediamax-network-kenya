I love the feeling of being in a club and enjoying myself without necessarily getting too wasted or sweating my sweet self on the dance floor. It’s a Saturday night I’m in the outskirts of Kisumu County. On my table is a tall chilled glass of Mai Tai cocktail, on my right, I enjoy the warm company of two interesting human beings. Cozy and classy is the best way to describe the Tulip Bar at Ciala Resort in Kisumu. Curvilinear seats cover almost all corners of the bar, giving it an elegant feel.  It feels like one of those members-only clubs.  Good grown-up music plays in the background and I can’t help but enjoy the pure bliss this place offers. Driving through to the hotel you would not expect to find this haven. It’s literally an upscale resort in the village.  I sit on a bar stool closer to the mixologist.  Just to get a view of the whole bar plus also, to get the order as fast as my thirst demands. I love me a mixologist who’s interactive, that way you get to know how your cocktail is done and what’s in it. There are two types of cocktail drinkers, those that eat the garnish, and those that don’t. Then there are those that are not sure, I guess there are three types of drinkers. Well, I eat my garnish, but what I can’t decide is whether to eat it before or after drinking the cocktail. The mixologist at Tulip Bar throws in the garnish, in all the cocktails, minus the serious masculine ones. He also controls the music playing in the background. It’s a classy pub not one of those rowdy discos. Here you dance with ease, in a relaxed environment, with a mature crowd. Drinks are pocket-friendly with local beers going for Sh300 and imports for Sh400. Cocktails range between Sh600 and Sh1,100.
