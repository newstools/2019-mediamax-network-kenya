Former Football Kenya Federation boss Sam Nyamweya has called on world governing body FIFA, in conjunction with Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), to investigate the federation and any other parties involved for possible criminal liability following the purchase of an Outside Broadcasting van at a cost of Sh 135 million. In a communiqué to media houses yesterday, Nyamweya says the probe should seek to establish where the van is and how it has benefited Kenyan football. Whether the supplier has reposed the van due to lack of payment? Whether the Federation involved a third party in the purchase and how the figure of Sh135M was arrived at among other issues. The van was acquired from South Africa based Multichoice whose two OB vans were still in the country after terminating their licence agreement with the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) limited in 2017. A fully equipped average brand new OB van is estimated to cost approximately Sh250 M.
