Nairobi, Tuesday @Peoplesports11 First Lady Margaret Kenyatta yesterday received over Sh163 million from  local corporates  in support of this year’s  Beyond Zero Marathon slated for March 10. Besides the cash donations from Beyond Zero’s traditional and new partners, sponsors and supporters, the First Lady also received additional support from Chinese Firm, Huawei Technologies, who presented 50 laptops to support healthcare delivery through the Medical Safaris. Receiving the donations in an event that marked her first official engagement this year, the First Lady said the Beyond Zero healthcare initiatives, including the recently launched medical safaris, have had a huge impact on health delivery to vulnerable populations especially in hard to reach parts of the country. “The impact on the ground is truly amazing. You can feel it and you can see it,” said First Lady Margaret Kenyatta as she thanked the 20 organisations for their support. The First Lady said her current focus is on Obstetric Fistula, a condition she said continues to frustrate many poor women including the elderly. All the CEOs and team leaders of the 20 corporate donors affirmed their support for Beyond Zero’s healthcare initiatives especially on maternal and child health. They also pledged to mobilise their employees to take part in the forthcoming marathon. The corporate donors included the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) whose team led by CEO Jeremy Ikindu Nguze gave Sh30 million and the Co-operative Bank of Kenya which gave Sh 20million. Kenya Commercial Bank’s  CEO Joshua Oigara led his team in donating Sh20 million. MediaMax, Kass, Nation Group, Capital FM and the Standard group represented the media fraternity with their donations of Sh25 million, Sh20 million, Sh10 million, Sh 12 million and  Sh 5 million respectively. Royal Media Services presented the First Lady with an Open Check.            – PSCU
