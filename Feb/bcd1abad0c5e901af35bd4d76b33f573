The National Land Commission has recommended the revocation of title deeds of thousands of acres of land grabbed from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF). They  include 35,000 acres in Archers Post in Samburu, 4,000 in Eldoret, 29.85 in Nanyuki, 29 in Karen and 2.51 in Kabete Barracks, Nairobi. An NLC report dated January 24 has directed the Chief Lands Registrar to cancel the titles and secure ownership documents to the KDF. “The commission recommends that the Chief Land Registrar revokes the purported titles and revert it  to the Principal Secretary Ministry of Defence,” says part of the report by the commission. NLC recommended that subdivisions and or titles issued in respect of portions of the land be declared null and void and be expunged from records. It says the land in Eldoret claimed by two groups was already gazetted for the Kenya Ordinance Factory and Recruit Training School. In its report, NLC confirms that about 34,000 acres of land for military training in Archers Post had been returned to KDF after Larisoro Ranch, which has been occupying it, agreed to a survey, which established an overlap. During public hearings, individuals claiming the 29 acres in Karen  failed to show up while directors of Giituamba Limited, which claims the parcel in Kabete Barracks sent a written submission. The claimants of the Nanyuki land failed to appear to defend their papers while in Eldoret, Leseru Tebson Farmers Society which has titles to 4,000 acres of the land appeared to defend their documents. NLC has already sent the report to the Ministry of Defence through the Office of PS Torome Saitoti and copied to Lands counterpart Nicholas Muraguri, the Chief Lands Registrar and NLC director of enforcement. Parties that lay claim to the parcels of land were also sent copies. NLC vice chair Abigael Mbagaya had earlier said the process of allocating the land was flawed.
