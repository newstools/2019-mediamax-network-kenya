Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A war of words has erupted between members of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and allies of Deputy President William Ruto over recent claims that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is involved in drug trafficking. Some ODM legislators, led by Minority Whip Junet Mohammed, came to Joho’s defence while others, including allies of Ruto, claimed to have evidence linking Joho to drug trafficking. Thirteen MPs, who yesterday revealed that Joho  (pictured) has written to Interpol to clear his name,  claimed the current attack against him is about 2022 politics and a reaction to president Uhuru Kenyatta’s move to bar politicians from politicking and launching what they termed fake projects. They  said every time the “tanga tanga team” lacks a 2022 agenda, they resort to personal attacks on leaders perceived to be threats to “whoever is sponsoring them”.  Addressing the press, the MPs claimed the remarks by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang and MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu) and Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) are unfounded. “The old and tired accusations have been overtaken by events,” said Mohamed, who was accompanied by MPs Mishi Mboko (Likoni), Babu Owino (Embakasi South) and Sam Atandi (Alego-Usonga), among others.
