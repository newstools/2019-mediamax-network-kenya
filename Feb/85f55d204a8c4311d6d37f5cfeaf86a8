Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 National Olympics Committee of Kenya (NOCK) boss Paul Tergat will pursue the case of hard-pressed Special Olympics gold medallist Susan Gatwiri who has accused some officials of swindling her hard-earned cash. Gatwiri, winner of two gold medals in Los Angeles, USA Special Olympics of 2015, is living in abject poverty despite her heroics in the games where Kenya won 26 gold, two silver and 12 bronze medals. “The welfare of athletes is one of our core mandates. It is heartening to learn what Gatwiri is going through. I want to promise her that we will do everything possible to know what really went wrong,” the NOCK boss said. According to the embattled athlete who won gold in 3,000m and 5,000m, the government had promised to reward all gold medallists with Sh200,000 each and she is therefore entitled to Sh400,000 which she has not received to date, forcing her to work as a house help to earn an extra coin. “I understand the government through the Ministry of Sport was supposed to pay her (Gatwiri) prizes for winning two gold medals from the games. I don’t know the current state of affairs but we have written to the ministry to find out,” added Tergat.
