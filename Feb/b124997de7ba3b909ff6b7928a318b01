In the fourth instalment of a seven-part series on stalled State projects, MARTIN MWITA examines drivers behind Kenya’s perennial water shortage The Water Ministry has piped Sh9.7 billion into stalled projects even as Kenyans continue to struggle with access to the precious commodity amid a takeover of the sector by cartels in Nairobi. The funds are part of a Sh15.1 billion budget channeled to the ministry to develop 14 key projects in different parts of the country, funded by both the government and foreign financing including grants. Projects under the State Department for Water Services are meant to receive Sh9.5 billion from the government while Sh5.6 billion is foreign financing, Treasury data shows. The water projects form part of the 545 stalled government development reported recently by Treasury, which has tabled a “stalled capital projects” document before Parliament indicating Sh72.5 billion has been spent on either white elephant or stuck projects. Projects developments According to the Treasury document signed by Principal secretary Kamau Thugge, Lake Victoria South Water Services Board accounts for a majority of the water projects (four), with the State Department receiving a Sh9.3 billion budget for seven projects including development of Badassa and Umaa dams at Sh6.6 billion. As of June 2018, Sh5.8 billion had been sunk into these developments among other related projects which require Sh3.6 billion to complete. The two mega dams have consumed Sh6.5 billion despite stalling at 50 per cent and 45 per cent complete. Water projects in Nyanza include the Kegati being developed at a cost of Sh120 million (fully funded by the government). The scheme which commenced in October 2010 with a completion timeline of June 2011, is currently at 75 per cent complete. About Sh68 million has been spent on the project which is now nearing a decade since its launch with Sh52 million required to complete it. A second project under the lake region initiative is the Rongo Water Supply Project being developed with a Sh80 million budget. It was started in November 2011 and was expected to be ready by June 2012. By the time of stalling, the project, which is 53 per cent complete, had swallowed Sh32 million. Completion rate East Uyoma Water Supply and West Uyoma Water Supply in the same region are also stagnant at 35 per cent and 90 per cent respectively. East Uyoma was initiated in November 2011 with its completion set for June 2012. It has sunk Sh3 million. At 90 per cent complete, West Uyoma which was launched in July 2009, has consumed Sh42 million. It was expected to be complete in June 2010. The four were budgeted for Sh305 million. The majority stalled as a result of “lack of adequate funding,” the ministry says. The adjacent Lake Victoria North Water Services Board, however, accounts for the lion’s share of funds channelled to the region’s water and sanitation initiatives. The board is responsible for implementation of the Nzoia Cluster Phase II-Lot I (Kakamega Town)-New Maraba sewerage system. The development was budgeted to consumer Sh2.7 billion and commenced in August 2008 during the Grand Coalition government. Though its completion was meant for August 2012, it stuck at 92 per cent, gobbling up Sh2.4 billion. About Sh285 million is required to finish work at the site. “The project was constructed to completion except Maraba sewerage system which was stopped following a stop order issued by the National Environment Tribunal in January 2010 following complaints by one landowner who petitioned the tribunal as he envisaged that the project will degrade the value of land in the area,” Thugge notes. At the time of stoppage, none out of 22 kilometres of sewer lines had been laid and earth works for the ponds was going on. Project financing “Land for the ponds and sewer lines way leaves had been acquired. The project was co-financed by the government of Kenya and KFW which withdrew its support for the project in 2014,” the National Treasury told Parliament in the project update report unveiled a week ago. State funds amounted to Sh7.04 billion while Sh2.3 billion was foreign. The State department is also hit by the stalemate of two projects at the Tana Water Services Board which were being developed on a Sh1.3 billion budget. They include Mathira Community Water (Sh380 million) launched in 2015 with a completion target of 2017 and the Maua Water Supply Distribution Network and Sewerage (Sh900 million) started in June 2016. It was also expected to be complete by December 2017 after being launched in June 2016. The two which were being fully funded by the foreign kitty have consumed Sh625 million to date with Sh655 million required for their completion.
