Addis Ababa, Ethiopia @PeopleSport11 First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has invited fellow African First Ladies to participate in the forthcoming Beyond Zero Marathon in Nairobi. The Kenyan First Lady expressed optimism that resources raised through this year’s Beyond Zero Marathon will help scale up the provision of health services to vulnerable women, children and the youth in Kenya. She thanked the private and public sectors as well as ordinary Kenyans for supporting her work through the Marathons, saying it has helped in the provision of much needed modern medical equipment and services. “This work is done through direct support from partners in the public and private sectors and also support from ordinary citizens who mobilise resources by running with me in the Beyond Zero Marathons,” she said. The First Lady was speaking in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the 22nd Ordinary General Assembly of the Organisation of African First Ladies Against HIV/Aids (OAFLA), which she co-chaired in her capacity as vice president of OAFLA, with First Lady Adjoavi Sika Kabore of Burkina Faso who is the President of the organisation. First Lady Kenyatta invited her fellow First Ladies to Kenya to participate in the 4th edition of the Marathon slated for March 10. She observed that Kenya is currently at full-scale implementation of the Point of Care Technology for early infant HIV diagnosis. “This has accelerated the diagnosis to less than 24 hours, leading to early initiation of treatment and improved follow-up for mothers and their children,” she said. During the meeting, the name of the First Ladies’ organisation was officially changed from the Organization of African First Ladies Against HIV/Aids to a more broad based Organisation of African First Ladies.                        – PSCU
