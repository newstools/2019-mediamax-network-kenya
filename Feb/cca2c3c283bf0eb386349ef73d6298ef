Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin The government requires Sh2.5 billion to complete 37 law courts projects and 13 regional, County and sub-county offices as President Uhuru Kenyatta’s freeze order on new projects nears its ninth month. These developments, initiated between 2005 and 2017, according to the National Treasury have either suffered “inadequate funding” or completely lacked funds to implement after being left out in the 2018/19 fiscal year budget. The 37 law courts, Judicial Service Commission (JSC) ,Competition Tribunal and Court of Appeal projects were initiated between 2013 and 2017 on a Sh3.5 billion budget. Provincial administration Construction of 13 offices at the county level were also launched by the government, some being developments from the defunct provincial administration system of governance under the old constitution. They include regional, county and sub-county offices, a project estimated to cost Sh743.9 million. The development is, however, stuck as a result of “inadequate funds” Treasury PS Kamau Thugge notes in the document presented to Parliament a fortnight ago. The court projects earmarked for development include Marsabit Law Courts with the highest budget at Sh370.2 million, Homa Bay Law Courts (Sh367.3 million), Kabarnet Law Courts (Sh366.8 million), Embu (Sh252.9 million), Mbita Law Courts (Sh148.3 million), Habasweini Law Courts (Sh143,2 million), Amagoro (Sh138 million), Kandara (Sh137.8 million), Githongo Law Courts (Sh130.9 million) and Mandera Law Courts (Sh107million). Others are Garsen, Runyenjes and Tawa Law Courts with a budget of Sh100 million each. Works at Nkubu Law Courts are budgeted to take Sh86 million while Eldama Ravine Law Courts will consume Sh81.9 million. The highest progress has been recorded at Nkubu, Siaya, Mombasa, Garsen and Bomet all at 100 per cent completion rate. However, Treasury has indicated that Sh 2.6 million, Sh1.1 million, Sh1.5 million, 9.7 million and Sh31.3 million is still required for the five projects respectively. The least progress is at Habasweini Law Courts whose works is at seven per cent completion, with Sh133.2 million required to complete the project. About Sh10 million has been spent on the facility so far.
