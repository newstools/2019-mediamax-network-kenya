Starehe MP Charles Njugua wants Education Amina Mohammed to order all secondary schools heads to admit Form One students even if they do not have the required fees. He said  despite the government’s efforts to have a 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary schools, many students are still at home because they cannot afford fees. The legislator said the students should be allowed to join school as their  parents work a way out to raise the money. “This transition cannot be achieved because some parents cannot afford to raise the money and thus they opt to keep their children at home” he said. He said one month down the line since Form One admission was closed, the children who are yet to join schools are losing out  and they might not be able to catch up with their colleagues. Meanwhile,  Murang’a leaders have lauded efforts by the stakeholders in education sector to mobilise resources to help needy students. About Sh70 million from  the county government, CDF, Affirmative action and other well wishers have been used to sponsor children joining Form One.
