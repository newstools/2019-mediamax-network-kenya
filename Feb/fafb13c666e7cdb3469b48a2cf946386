Ushuru left it to late securing a point against a stubborn Kisumu Allstars in a 1-1 draw at Ruaraka Grounds Friday. The lakeside team who had led for most of the match, lapsed in the dying minutes when Edwin Mwaura lobbed the ball over the Allstars custodian Geoffrey Were following a short corner in the 91st minute of play. The opener for the visitors inside 26 minutes came against the run of play as an offensive move from the left wing engineered by Bobby Kwaka teed Seth Oyugi for the ball and the resultant cross was well connected by an overlapping Moses Okumu to shake the taxmen. A defensive-minded Allstars worked overtime to frustrate the opponents using man marking with lethal attacker Brian Yakhama neutralised. The second half saw the lakeside outfit go all out defensive as they closed the spaces. In the meantime Ushuru brought in lively Ken Sunga and creative midfielder Oscar Mbugua to replace the ineffective Jeremiah Wanjala and Fan Ngaira. Meanwhile, Kibera Black Stars earned their first win of the campaign after a  1-0 win away at Bukhungu to move them to eight points in the standings. At the same time Administration Police moved to seventh with 20 points after a 3-1 drubbing over Kangemi Allstars at Camp Toyoyo. Elsewhere, Michael Owino’s 87th minute goal was enough to see off visiting Coast Stima 1-0 for Bidco United at Thika Stadium. NSL RESULTS: Ushuru 1-1 Kisumu Allstars; Bidco Utd 1-0 Coast Stima; AP 3-1 Kangemi Allstars; Green Commandoes 0-1 Kibera Black Stars; Eldoret Youth 0-1 Modern Coast Rangers.
