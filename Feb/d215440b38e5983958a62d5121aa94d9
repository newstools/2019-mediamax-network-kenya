The chase is tightening and contenders of the National Super League (NSL) want to close out the remainder of the first leg on a high. With positive results today, the ambition for promotion to the challengers can be enhanced. However, two fixtures look enticing this afternoon in Nairobi and Naivasha while at Ruaraka another contest could very well determine who gets a head start before end of first leg. A juicy duel is awaited between top place Wazito (38 points) and third place Nairobi Stima at the fortress that is Karuturi Grounds. This is a battle between two free scoring sides that collectively have netted 55 goals and are only separated by four points gap. Wazito tactician Mohamed Mchulla is predicting a tough clash urging his charges to be wary of the opponents.”We will be facing a compact side defensively and an even dangerous upfront. We must be ready for a difficult match away for sure. It is our discipline which will help us out,” he told People Sport. Wazito will rely on services of David Orem, Teddy Osok and Kennedy Ayako while Stima will be buoyed at home by the hunger of Benjamin Chaka and Eric Kinuthia. Meanwhile at Camp Toyoyo, fast, rising Administration Police host recovering Shabana in a duel coach Gilbert Selebwa will be hoping for maximum returns. Speaking earlier to this paper, Selebwa whose team overcame a demoralising seven-match winless run to bounce back with three consecutive wins said they were on course. “It is all about mental strength because we have the right personnel to do the job,” he said of sixth-placed ‘Tore Bobe’.
