In the new Village Market wing right next to Trademark Hotel, you will find Afta Eats, a dessert bar with a menu laden with desserts, obviously, as well as healthy treats. I stumbled upon it, more like roamed Village Market till I found it, after a recommendation by a friend. The kitchen island is in the middle, where everything is prepared fresh and on order. The walls are decorated with faux grass and faux flowers, as well as several art pieces which elevate the jointâ€™s aesthetic appeal. You can choose to sit on a high stool or in the booths. Either way, you get free WiFi and are surrounded by sockets for your laptop or phone. I took one booth, and the same lady who had warmly welcomed me approached to take my order. I ordered a super bowl and a smoothie as I waited for my colleague for our work date. She joined me five minutes later, just when I was working myself up into a good lather and threatening her with life altering consequences in my head. I almost wished she had come in later, just so I could dress her down with my almost perfect denigrating speech, which was useless now, because five minutes late in Africa is darn early. She ordered waffles topped off with caramel sauce. My healthy bowl arrived and it was teeming with strawberries, bananas, granola, quinoa and other tasty superfoods, all floating on a thick berry paste. It looked very healthy and I was surprised to find that it was sumptuous and filling as well. I managed to steal some waffles from my friend and they were toasty and warm with slight crunch. We revelled in our smoothies as we traded stories. We are both coming back here to try out more things on the menu. I will definitely show up for this, albeit exactly five minutes late.
