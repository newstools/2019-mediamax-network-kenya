Rodgers Ndegwa @PeopleSport11 Series leader Onkar Rai will miss out on the next round of the KCB Kenya National Rally Championship citing pressing commitments. The three-time Nakuru Rally winner says he already had prior commitments and as such, cannot partake the Kenya Motor Sports Club (KMSC) round slated for Kajiado on the first weekend of March. But the Nakuru-based former KNRC Division Two champion promised to resume the hunt for the coveted title once he makes a comeback in the third leg in Eldoret. Rai beat Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo by just four seconds in a flat out last stage shootout to seal a hat-trick of Nakuru wins in the season opening event which revolved around Mogotio and Gicheha Farm two weeks ago. “I had a prior commitment and won’t be present for the second event. Depending on how it goes, we will be back in the third rally to resume our title aspirations,” said Rai, who is yet to lay his hands on the KNRC main class title. Rai leads the KNRC log with 25 points ahead of defending champion Tundo who is four points adrift with multiple winner Chager in third spot on 21 points. His elder sibling Tejveer Rai, who incidentally was a road sweeper in Nakuru, is fourth with 15 points. Tejveer is among the drivers affected by the scrapping of the B13 class which permitted crews the use of a bigger restrictor and a sequential gearbox. Others are Chager and Tundo. With the B13 rule, the Mitsubishi Evolution Xs possessed the requisite ammunition to tackle the Skoda Fabia R5 make which swept the ground with all and sundry in Nakuru. “The top boys are really fast so it will be quite difficult to chase them,” Tejveer said. Chager weighed in: “The larger 34mm restrictor and sequential boxes had added a little zest last year making the cars a little faster and fun to drive. So to keep up with the R5 category cars, I guess we just have to try even harder this year.”  Ian Duncan driving a Nissan pickup and navigated by Anthony Nielsen was the biggest casualty in Nakuru.
