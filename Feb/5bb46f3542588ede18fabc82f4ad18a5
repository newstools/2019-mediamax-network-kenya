Irene Githinji @gitshee A series of anomalies have been identified in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Nairobi Government and Kenya County Government Workers Union, with fears that it might set a bad precedence if allowed. Nairobi is the first to develop what has been termed as flawed agreement and there are fears that if replicated in other counties, it  could further overburden taxpayers. Statistics on the annual cost implication for only three items basic salary, house and commuter allowances will be an estimated Sh1.6 billion for Nairobi alone if the CBA is allowed and Sh23.5 billion for 31 counties whose data were available. The cost implication excludes items not fixed and recurrent in nature, for instance extraneous and non-practice allowances. Salaries Remuneration Commission (SRC) has raised concerns of affordability of the CBA saying the county audited statements for the last three years, 2016/17, 2015/16 and 2015/14 financial years, had a disclaimer opinion. “The auditor could not form an opinion on the statements due to material misstatements and discrepancies in the figures including lack of properly kept financial records…the figures cannot therefore be fully relied upon to make decisions,” SRC documents indicate. “The statements indicate that the county has been making profits of an average Sh213.5 million over the three years. “Even if financial records were accurate, any increase in the expenditure in terms of compensation to employees above the Sh214 million is neither affordable nor sustainable,” they further stated. It has also emerged that the scope of the CBA has included employees of devolved government and county public service board, which is an irregularity since they are not employees of the defunct local authorities.
