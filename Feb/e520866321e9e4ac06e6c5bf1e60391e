About 29 elderly people have been killed in Kilifi county in the last two years for allegedly practising witchcraft. Kilifi county commissioner Magu Mutindika blamed the killings on “false prophets who use biblical doctrines to claim that elderly people in the county, mostly in the villages, are witches who deserve to be killed”. He said: “The false prophets are indeed the cause of increased killings of elderly people as they claim to get divine visions in their prayers and hence incite people to get rid of them.” Addressing the press on the phone on Friday, Mutindika warned the ‘false prophets’ to stop their vilification of elderly people or they will face the law. Haki Yetu organisation director Gabriel Dolan said most of the murdered 29 elderly people hail from Rabai sub-county, among other parts of the county, and also pointed fingers at the ‘false prophets’ as the cause of the killings. The organisation’s acting manager Julius Wanyama said the ‘false prophets’ ask for up to Sh20,000 to conduct prayers to expose the elderly witches, which leads to the killings. Contacted, Rabai  criminal investigation officer John Lelei said the elderly people are asked to either commit suicide or be murdered.
