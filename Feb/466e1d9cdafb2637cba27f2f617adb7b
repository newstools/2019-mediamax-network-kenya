Warsaw, Thursday United States Vice President Mike Pence accused Washington’s European allies on Thursday of trying to break US sanctions against Tehran and called on them to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. “Sadly, some of our leading European partners have not been nearly as cooperative. In fact, they have led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions,” Pence said during a conference on the Middle East organised by the US in Warsaw. Pence said a scheme set up by the EU to facilitate trade with Iran was “an effort to break American sanctions against Iran’s murderous revolutionary regime”. “It is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and the United States,” he said. The Warsaw meeting was attended by more than 60 nations but major European powers such as Germany and France, part to the 2015 nuclear accord, refused to send their top diplomats. Sanctions relief The European Union, including summit host Poland, has shown no sign of rejecting the accord negotiated under former US president Barack Obama in which Iran constrained its nuclear programme in return for promises of sanctions relief. EU officials say they acknowledge concerns about Iran but believe the deal, with which Tehran has complied, is working and that the clerical state is not the only problematic actor in the region. “The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and join with us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure necessary to give the Iranian people, the region and the world the peace, security and freedom they deserve,” he said. -Agencies
