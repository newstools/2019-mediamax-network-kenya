ADAK CEO, Japhter Rugut said that the first programme commenced in earnest with training their first group of 200 Fourth-year students from various sports course disciplines. Speaking yesterday during the launch, Rugut announced that this would be the beginning of a long partnership and relationship with Kenyatta University which is arguably Kenya`s academic bastion for sports education, Heralding  a new dawn in the collaborative effort between a National Anti-Doping Organisation (NADO) and Academia. “This workshop serves as a milestone for the agency in terms of our collaborative effort in fighting against doping. It is our prayer that this programme will be an annual event with the objective of equipping our future sports professionals with necessary information on the promotion of clean sport,” said Rugut. Rugut made his remarks in the wake of high-doping cases that saw close to 114 Kenyan athletes testing positive to doping and 54 of them being sanctioned. The CEO requested the management of the university to consider introducing an examinable unit on Anti-Doping for sports related courses citing that this would be a great boost to the fight against doping in sports in Kenya as the knowledge acquired in training will provide a firm base which will ensure athletes will engage in clean sports.
