A 30-year-old nurse at Amref-Kenya disappeared from her house in Tena estate, Nairobi last Thursday leaving her family and friends agonised. Prior to her disappearance, Margaret Kilelu had been hospitalised at Kenyatta National Hospital for a depression-related illness but was discharged on Sunday last week when doctors gave her a clean bill of health. The mother of two, who lost her husband Stephen Omollo  in unclear circumstances in November last year, was last seen near Bee Centre roundabout on Thursday. Her family’s efforts to trace her have bore no fruit after her mobile phone went unanswered and subsequent searches in hospitals and mortuaries unsuccessful. Omollo, also a medic who run a clinic on Ngong Road bequeathed the premise which had accrued rent arrears to his wife months before his death. Kilelu’s family says financial pressures may have led their daughter to depression after the clinic was auctioned. Her sister, Mercy, said on the day she disappeared, Kilelu left the house and said she would be back shortly, only for her not to show up by end of the day. “We were at her house in Tena with my mother and a sister-in-law. My mother had travelled from Voi to see her because she had been discharged from hospital just a few days earlier,” said Mercy. The family has reported the matter at Buru Buru Police Station.
