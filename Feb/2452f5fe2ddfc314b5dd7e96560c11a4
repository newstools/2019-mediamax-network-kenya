Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The French firm that was awarded the multi billion-shilling tender to supply electoral materials in the 2017 General Election yesterday said it fairly won the tender and delivered on the contract. Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, IDEMIA, formerly OT-Morpho,  senior vice president Olivier Charlanes and  executive vice-president Mathew Foxton, said that they did not use anyone to canvass for the tender worth Sh6.7 billion. According to them, their meetings with commissioners were  formal and structured even as they clarified that it was the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) that engaged them directly to provide the equipment as the commission had limited time before the elections. Charlanes said the company had delivered as per its contractual obligation. “As a company, we have no doubt that we dutifully provided a robust system to IEBC as part of our commitment to empower citizens to vote in ways that are now possible in a connected environment,” he told the committee chaired by Opiyo Wandayi. Kiems kits In the last general election, IEBC awarded the firm a Sh4.19 billion tender to supply the 45,000 Kenya Integrated Election Management System (Kiems) kits used in the August 8, 2017, elections and another Sh2.5 billion for the repeat presidential election on October 26. They told the committee that  they had been doing business with the Kenya government since 2008 and had supplied the Kenyan Police with a criminal Automated Palm and Fingerprints Identification System (APFIS) while in 2012, they delivered a robust biometric voter registration system to the IEBC.  IDEMIA (formerly OT-Morpho) is a French company with headquarters in Paris.
