Irene Githinji @gitshee After several months of waiting, former Director of Criminal Investigations Ndegwa Muhoro has finally taken up his ambassadorial role in Malaysia. Muhoro was handed the position last June but officially took office this week, almost eight months after his appointment. “Good morning family and friends and a very blessed day. We arrived safely yesterday in Malaysia for my new assignment…be blessed,” Muhoro said in a short text message, yesterday morning. Muhoro takes office amid reports that some of the envoys had been rejected by host countries hence the delay to report to their stations. However, Foreign Affairs ministry dismissed the claims saying deployment of envoys is within conventional timelines consistent with global practice. The ministry said that modalities for preparation of deployment were on course and that Kenya has never had any envoy rejected by any country. “All the host countries are ready to receive them and have began to do so. Every country schedules the presentation ceremonies at specific times depending on their traditions and availability of the Heads of State,” the Ministry said last week. “Deployment of this group of envoys has been based on a careful assessment of respective envoys’ intrinsic and wider value to the promotion of Kenya’s national interest and foreign policy,” the ministry added. Muhoro was among nine ambassadors President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed last June and were later vetted by National Assembly’s Committee on Defence and Foreign Relations in July. This is not the first time that the government has had to defend the delayed deployment.
