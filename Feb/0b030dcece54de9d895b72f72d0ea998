A 14-year-old girl, who scored 314 marks in the 2018 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam, is among thousands others who have not joined secondary school in Coast region despite government insisting on a 100 per cent transition. The girl from Kashani village in Kisauni was selected to join Mwasere Girls Secondary School in Taita Taveta county. Esther Siri fears she may lose her position at the school because her single mother is unable to raise the required school fees. The school has insisted that the girl must pay the school fees before she is admitted. “My mother ekes a living doing menial jobs. The money is not even enough for our basic needs,” she said. However, she said she was still hopeful that a Good Samaritan would pay her first term school fees amounting to Sh35,700 to enable her accomplish her dream of becoming a doctor. Her mother Tumaini Karisa said that besides paying school fees, she was required to buy books  and other items. “I have visited many offices among them Mombasa Governor’s Hassan Joho seeking assistance to enable my daughter go to school but no help has been forthcoming,” she said.
