Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Activist Okiya Omtatah has challenged in court the latest Boards of State corporations appointments by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Omtatah wants court to quash the appointments, saying they were made in contempt of court orders. Among those gazzetted are poll losers Wavinya Ndeti who lost Machakos governor election, former governors Joshua Irungu (Laikipia) and David Nkedianye (Kajiado). Others are Gonzi Rai, who lost the Kinango MP seat, former Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu, former assistance minister Kalembe Ndile and ex- Taita Taveta Woman Rep Joyce Lay. Omtatah has named National Executive of the Republic, Public Service Commission, State Corporations Advisory Committee and the Attorney General as the respondents in the suit. He said the court last month ruled that future appointments should be based on the law and should be fair, open, competitive, merit-based and through an inclusive process.
