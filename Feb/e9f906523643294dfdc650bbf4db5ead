George Kebaso @Morarak More than 300 guards from KK Security firm, who were dismissed by the US Embassy for protesting alleged delay of overtime allowances, peg their hopes for reinstatement on negotiations between their union and the employer. The guards yesterday urged their employer to reinstate them, saying they were duped to stage a sit-in over delayed overtime allowances amounting to Sh1 billion. Kenya National Private Security Workers Union (KNPSWU) secretary general Isaac Andabwa blamed the sacking of the guards, allied to the union, on his Kenya Private Universities Workers Union (KPUWU) counterpart Peter Owiti. He accused Owiti of wrongly advising the 358 security guards to down their tools. Andabwa said the disputed  allowance was being implemented and urged KK Security management to rescind its decision.
