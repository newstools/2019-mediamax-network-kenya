Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The government has established a multisectoral team to scrutinise all pending bills at the National Youth Service (NYS) before the National Treasury releases funds to service them. This came on the day it emerged that already Sh2.3 billion has been paid for bills occurred before July 2016. Youth Principal Secretary Francis Owino yesterday told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the National Assembly that no payment will be made  before vouchers are verified . The Sh2.3 billion paid to suppliers is part of the Sh2.5 billion pending bills that the ministry had accrued as at July 2016. The team has been scrutinising bills for the past one-and-half months and will forward the results to the Cabinet secretary for action. Once approved, he said, the ministry will advise the Treasury to release funds. “As part of restructuring, the ministry has put in place a team to look at the bills. They have been on it for the last one-and-half months,” he said. NYS Director General Matilda Sakwa assured the team they have put in place systems at NYS to ensure no money is lost at the service again. The sentiments by Owino came even as the PAC team led by chair Opiyo Wandayi demanded to know why some people at NYS were paid more than Sh15 million as imprests. They sought to know whether there are caps on how much an individual can be granted in imprests. Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo sought to know when the balance of Sh200 million in respect to pending bills will be cleared.  Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro told the officials to ensure no money is lost at the service.
