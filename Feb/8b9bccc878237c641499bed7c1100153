James Waindi @Magayijim Rwanda international Andre Cassa Mbungo yesterday became AFC Leopard’s 27th coach in a space of 10 years, as he replaced Serbian Marko Vasiljevic who resigned on Sunday after a humiliating 4-1 defeat at the hands of local league rivals Bandari. With his appointment yesterday, Mbungo signed a 18-month contract with the club, becomes the third tactician to be in charge of the 13 times local champions this season, just two months into the season and it will be a question of waiting to see how long he would occupy the hot seat, given the high turn-over of coaches in the club. Leopards started the season with the appointment of Serbian Nikola Kavazovic who vanished from the team just two weeks after his unveiling, even before the new season could kick off, citing interference in his work by a section of club officials. His replacement and countryman Vasiljevic threw in the towel on Sunday after a spate of poor results which has left the team 15th on the League standings after 10 rounds of matches. Last year they had three coaches handling the team as they finished the league outside top five. The trio included Robert Matano, Dennis Kitambi and Argentine Rodolpho Zapata. The 52- year-old Rwandan tactician has no time to rest and will get a baptism by fire as he takes charge of the team in their crucial SportPesa Premier League clash against Mount Kenya United in Machakos this afternoon, despite only being in charge for a single training session. The club have confirmed the arrival of Mbungo in a statement; “AFC Leopards has appointed Rwandese Andre Casa Mbungo as our new coach on a one-and-a-half-year deal. Andre replaces Marko Vasiljevic, who resigned on Monday.” This came hours after former coach Kitambi turned down the offer to return to the Den for another stint. Mbungo is credited for nurturing Gor Mahia forwards Jacques Tuyisenge and Francis Mustafa at Police and Kiyovu clubs respectively during different spells.
