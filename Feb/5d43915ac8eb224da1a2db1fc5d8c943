A Nakuru family which was recently  handed a home by a well-wisher has now had its three children enrolled into a cash transfer programme for the physically challenged. National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD) director Hussein Gabow said the family of Charles  Gachie, a single father of six, had passed the eligibility criteria for the cash transfer programme. The cash transfer programme targeting 47, 200 households is being implemented by the Department of Social Security and Services in collaboration with the NCPWD. Last Sunday, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner Mongo Chimwaga ushered them into the new home at Murunyu village in Bahati. Gabow said the council will also make a contribution towards payment of school fees for the three children with disabilities and monitor their progress to ensure  they lead normal lives. “The mobility of these children is of primary concern. By next week we will be delivering a motorised tricycle that will facilitate their movements to and from school. We have also registered them with the council,” said the director. An elated Gachie thanked well-wishers for their kind gesture. “This is a dream come true. We wish to thank all those who have made a  positive impact in our lives,”  he said. County Commissioner Erastus Mbui Mwenda called on other well-wishers to extend their help to the family. – KNA
