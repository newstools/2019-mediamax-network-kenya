Mercy Salisi Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been crowned the Good Deeds Ambassador by an Israel-based organisation for his generosity towards the needy in society. This follows the Israel delegation’s visit to Sonko on December 11, last year, at City Hall, Nairobi.  During the visit, the delegation, led by the Good Deeds global chief executive Kaynan Rabino, named Sonko as their ambassador, a title he’ll hold for three years. Sonko was feted Friday at a Nairobi Hotel in an event attended by Israel Ambassador to Kenya Noah Gal Gendler and Rabino, among others. During the three-year period, Sonko will be expected to spearhead cohesion, reconciliation and promotion of peace across the country, encourage inclusivity, good governance and tolerance in discharging his mandate as the governor of a county, which enjoys the largest diversity and economic potential in the country, among others. In his acceptance speech, Sonko said he supports the mission of getting people to volunteer and choose to help others. “This is a noble cause that will make the world a better place, and improve the lives of our fellow men and women,” he said. A few years ago, Sonko set up Sonko Rescue Team, an organisation aimed at responding to the suffering and frustration of wananchi, especially in low-income areas. Gendler said Sonko has a good heart and has helped a lot of people and that is why he deserves the honour.
