It was sweet victory for Wajir governor Mohamed Abdi after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld his election.  The top court overturned the decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal that had nullified Abdi’s win. Justices Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung’u, Jackton Ojwang and  Mohammed Ibrahim ruled in favour of Abdi, while Chief Justice David Maraga and Justice Isaac Lenaola dissented. Maraga said in his view, the High Court was right in nullifying his election because he was not qualified and because of irregularities. The judges said the lower courts wrongly assumed jurisdiction on determining what was clearly a pre-election dispute regarding Abdi’s academic qualifications. According the judges, the  governor’s predecessor and rival in the election, Ahmed Abdullahi, failed to file the complaint to the IEBC when he realised the governor did not have requisite academic credentials. In a judgment read by Justice Smokin Wanjala, the Supreme Court said the former governor did not pursue the original complaint at IEBC which had been lodged by Mohamed Abdille. “He decided to ignore the established mechanisms of solving election disputes until after he had lost the election,” said judges. Abdi was represented by lawyer Fred Ngatia, while lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi  represented the former governor
