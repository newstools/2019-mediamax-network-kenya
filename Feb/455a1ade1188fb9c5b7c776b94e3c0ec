Coach Edward Opio of Catholic Monks and his league challenger Dennis Mwanja of United States International University – Africa (USIU-Africa) Martials are buoyant that their charges will rise to the occasion and beat Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship League debutants Masinde Muliro University and Kitale RFC when they visit the two newbies this weekend. Coach Opio’s side is at the helm of the league standings with 32 points from eight matches, a point above Mwanja’s USIU-Africa who are second on 31 points and the two high-flying and former Kenya Cup top tier sides, are banking on their proper team structures and form to get wins that will keep rising above the rest as they eye to make a return to the topflight rugby league, Kenya Cup by end of the season. “Having watched one of MMUST games against USIU, they are a very physical side but lacks structure and leadership on the pitch and we intend to explore this weakness. We do have equally physical side but our structured game play is what might carry the day,” buoyant Monks coach Edward Opio said. “I also intend to use a fairly young side compared to the regulars I have been using. So, this will be a game between a structured side against individual brilliance of the MMUST side,” added coach Opio. MMUST and Kitale playing their debut season in this second tier, have recorded contrasting results with the former surprising many as they sit eight with 14 points from four wins and similar loses but the latter have been unlucky as they sit bottom on the log with 10 points from two wins out of eight matches. Meanwhile, third-placed Western Bulls on 28 points will also be eyeing to keep in touch with the leading duo when they welcome second-last side, South Coast Pirates who have only managed one win (walkover against Kisii RFC) while third-last Egerton Wasps on 12 points make a trip to Kisii to lock horns with fast fading and sixth-placed Kisii RFC who are on 16 points.
