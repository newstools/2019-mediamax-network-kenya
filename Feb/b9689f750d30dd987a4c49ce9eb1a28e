Seven businessmen accused of using President Uhuru Kenyatta’s name and receiving Sh10 million were yesterday released on a cash bail of Sh100,000 each. Appearing before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi,  the seven — Joseph Waswa, Duncan Muchai, Isaac Wajekeche, William Simiyu, David Luganya, Gilbert Kirunja and Anthony Wafula — denied a charge of conspiracy to defraud Sameer Africa finance director Akif Hamid Butt. The prosecution alleged that the seven committed the offence on diverse dates between January 24 and February 1 at Prime Bank in Riverside Drive, Nairobi county by falsely pretended to be in a position to sell to Sameer Africa a piece of land LR No.10090/118 situated in Milimani area, Nairobi county. Three years in prison In his ruling, the magistrate indicated that the offences facing the suspects are serious and if found guilty, the suspects could face up to three years in prison. Andayi, however, declined to allow police detain them for 30 days but ordered them to report at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) offices every Friday as investigations continue. He further granted them an alternative bond of Sh200,000 with a surety of similar amount. The seven were charged after principal magistrate Peter Ooko dismissed an application filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to have the suspects detained for 10 days toenable police complete investigations. The case will be mentioned on March 17.
