Ipoa head of communication Dennis Okech said they have raised the matter with Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and it is only a matter of time before the officers are removed from the police service. “We cannot have criminals in the police who have perfected a habit of harassing women and innocent passengers. We must clean the police service,” said Okech On Friday, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji wrote to Makadara Magistrate asking him not to proceed with Njeri’s case because she was innocent and the said traffic police officers are the ones who deserve to be investigated. Meanwhile, Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i, has asked Boinnet, to probe the officers who were involved in the incident and forward the report to him on Monday.
