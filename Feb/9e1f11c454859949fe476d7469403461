Mercy Gacheche and Natasha Waithera @PeopleDailyKe Shortage of public service vehicles and high fares yesterday left many students returning to school after the mid-term break stranded. PSV operators took advantage of the influx of students to double and even triple fares. A spot check by People Daily revealed that students and commuters travelling from Nairobi to Runyenjes paid Sh1,000 from the normal Sh500. Those travelling to Nanyuki from Nairobi paid up to Sh800 with the prices expected to continue increasing within the course of the day. Students returning to school in Karatina and Nyeri had to part with Sh600 up from Sh300. Hellen Mwangi, a parent accompanying her daughter who is a student at St Monica Munyaka in Nanyuki expressed frustration due to lack of means of transport after spending over two hours at the bus stop. “The sun is scorching and with no signs of a bus or matatu. We might end up going back home and try our luck tomorrow,” she said. She feared her daughter would be sent back home if she fails to be in school by 4pm, which is the deadline set by the institution. In Mombasa, students returning to school after the mid-term break were also stranded in bus termini after fare hikes. At the Mwembe Tayari bus terminus, many of the students remained unsure of whether they would be able to reach their schools in time. Fare to Voi had rose from Sh300 to Sh700, Mombasa to Nairobi increased to Sh1,600 from Sh1,200 while those travelling to Taveta paid Sh500.
