Gor Mahia FC has accused local media of blowing the issue of money owed to the club’s celebrated striker Dennis Oliech out of proportion. The club’s Chief Executive Officer Lordick Aduda said Oliech has neither issued an ultimatum nor threatened to boycott training or being involved in matches, even as he shed light on the agreement the management had with the player over the unpaid Sh 3 million sign-on fee. Aduda said they had a mutual agreement to pay Oliech the fee in two instalments the first one is in February 2019 and the second in August 2019. “This was the arrangement and I fail to understand what the hullabaloo is all about. In any case, February has not ended yet some quarters are shouting on rooftops that Oliech has been short-changed,” said Aduda. He added: “I have only read the alleged ultimatum in the press. Gor is a club that operates in a professional manner and would not like its name dragged into mud.” He further added that the management has been kind enough to include Oliech among the players who were beneficiaries of Sh 100,000 token of appreciation after the club reached the CAF Cup Group stage despite the player having not played a part in the qualification.
