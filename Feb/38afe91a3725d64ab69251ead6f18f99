Shanzu Resident magistrate David Odhiambo has recused himself from hearing a matter in which a Turkish man has been charged with defiling three underage girls at his palatial home in Kikambala, Kilifi county. The magistrate withdrew from the case in which Elsek Osman has been charged with eight counts of defilement after the prosecution, through State counsel Eugene Wangila, made an application to have the matter moved to Malindi Law Courts citing influence from judicial officers. Odhiambo said Shanzu Law Courts was not in a position to proceed with the hearing of the matter as the suspect had a personal relationship with one of the prosecutors stationed at the court and Osman  had invested millions in the construction of the court building  as part of his corporate social responsibility (CSR). “My court has established that he had a very close relationship with the prosecutor in charge of the court and, therefore, this court cannot proceed with the hearing since there is a conflict of interest,” he
said. Osman has since denied eight counts of child abuse and two counts of indecent act with three children, two aged 15 and another 17, at his Kikambala residence. The court was informed that Osman defiled the three between February and October, last year.
The matter matter will be mentioned on March 11.
