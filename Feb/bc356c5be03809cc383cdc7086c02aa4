The government will stop financial transactions of errant savings and credit co-operative societies (Saccos), including payment of bills by mobile phone transactions, to seal loopholes of misappropriation. Cabinet Secretary of Trade, Industry and Co-operatives Peter Munya said he was aware that some mobile service providers were violating the Co-operatives Act by allowed such financial transfers to continue. “I have instructed the Commissioner of Cooperatives to file a complaint at the Communication Authority of Kenya in respect to mobile service providers that fail to honour such directives thereby frustrating efforts to safeguard funds of Sacco members,” said Munya. He assured Sacco members that the government will ensure Saccos countrywide are financially sound and well-managed. “The government will not have mercy on anyone found guilty of covert or impropriety in the administration of members’ funds,” Munya said at his NSSF Building office yesterday Munya said his ministry is concerned about the slow process of reimbursing members of the controversy-ridden Ekeza Sacco in Kiambu county.
