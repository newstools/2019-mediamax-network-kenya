In Taita Taveta mayoral chain appears to have disappeared decades ago.Authorities in the current Assembly appear clueless of how the once highly-guarded symbols of authority vanished from the defunct council chambers. Contacted, County Secretary Samuel Mwanyasi said he  knows little about the chain because he has never handled matters related to it. Interrogate situation Similarly, the incoming Clerk Gadiel Maganga, said he has no information on the chain. He requested for a  week to interrogate the situation saying he was only three weeks old in office. But former Voi Mayor Hope Anisa who held the post between 2009 and 2011, claims the chain could have disappeared long ago because it never existed even during her time. In Mombasa, the pioneer Speaker Thaddeus Rajwayi claimed shortly after the county started operating, the chain and other mayoral symbols were handed over to Transitional Authority—the body mandated by law to secure all assets of the bodies that were replaced by the 47 county governments after the promulgation of the Constitution in 2010, His statement, however, contradicts that of former Mombasa County Assembly clerk Tubman Otieno, three years ago who said he will not honour the Transition Authority’s directive to surrender the ceremonial chain saying the golden chain worth Sh10 million will be kept at the Assembly as a souvenir.
