Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) yesterday admitted the first company into its “Ibuka” programme, an incubation and acceleration platform that will help address the listing drought at the bourse. Admission of APT Commodities Ltd (APTC) follows a rigorous vetting process that made the firm the first among an elite cadre of enterprises expected to join the “Ibuka” –Swahili for emerging  – plan. NSE Chief executive  officer, Geoffrey Odundo said the admission was a milestone for both APT Commodities Ltd and the bourse. “This programme will enable companies to unlock their growth potential through a well-structured incubation programme that places a special focus on enhancing the select companies’ business structure, visibility and ability to attract investment among local and international investors,” he said during the admission ceremony in Nairobi. He said APT Commodities Ltd has accomplished phase one of the programme and is set to undergo the second phase – which will eventually allow the firm to undertake an Initial Public Offering (IPO) before eventually getting listed in the NSE. Capital markets Odundo said he expects 20 more companies to go through the “Ibuka” programme before they finally get listed on the bourse. He said not many companies have been able to list in the capital markets in the past because the approach was not right. He said NSE has been taking different approaches – sensitising the public and involving transaction advisors to enable potential firms to come on board, but with little progress. Peter Gitata, APT Commodities Ltd, chief executive officer, said they are moving into the second phase of the Ibuka programme and hope to undertake an IPO in six months upon completion of the task.
