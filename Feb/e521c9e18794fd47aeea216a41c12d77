MUTWIRI MURIITHI Motorists are set to enjoy seamless car parking following the launch of a new cashless parking payment system. A partnership between Safaricom and Kenya Airports Parking Services (Kaps) will enable motorists across the country to pay for their parking. The telco will integrate M-Pesa to the Kaps platform, allowing cashless payments at more than 50 locations including malls and hospitals. “We realised that parking is one of the services that still relies heavily on cash and there was a gap for us to offer our customers convenience, ease and simplicity to pay parking fees. Motorists can now enjoy the freedom from having to carry around cash, the hassle of looking for change and queuing simply to pay for parking,” said Safaricom chief financial services officer Sitoyo Lopokoiyoit. “Our goal is to increase payment options to consumers not only to malls but also to the streets to make it convenient for them,” he added. By dialing *486#, customers can pay for their parking or use their M-Pesa 1Tap cards in place of the Kaps card to access and exit parking lots. Kaps chief executive Bonnyventure Saronge said, “We have been on a journey to drive cashless parking payments and we are glad to partner with Safaricom in this initiative.” The move complements the prepaid Kaps A-card Tap in Tap out service, which has been in the market for some time and has been well received by customers.
