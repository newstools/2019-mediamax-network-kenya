Lands Cabinet Secretary Faridah Karoney has warned ministry officials who collude with criminals to defraud members of the public that they will be sacked and face the full force of the law. She said some officers collude with criminals to manipulate land records. Speaking during a fact finding mission in Kisii county yesterday, the CS it was ironical that fraudsters can access government seals and stamps to grab public and private land. She said the national government will share the digitised records with the counties and the Judiciary to enable the latter use it as evidence to hear and dispense land cases quickly, adding the records will be kept at the Ministry’s headquarters. The CS said the government will set up a task force to establish the status of public and private land, adding those who had grabbed land will be forced to surrender it. “We want the task force comprising officers from the national land Commission, the ministry and the county to give a report on grabbed public land and encroached riparian area” Karoney said.
