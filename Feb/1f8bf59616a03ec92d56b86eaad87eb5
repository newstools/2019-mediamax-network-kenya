Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) yesterday asked the High Court to dismiss an application by former Youth PS Lilian Omollo to vary the freeze order on her bank accounts. In its submission, ARA asked Justice Hedwig Ong’udi not to allow the release of Sh6.8 million monthly to Omollo from her frozen accounts as her application has no merit and is misconceived. “Allowing her to access the funds will render the case useless, she has other means, we pray that you dismiss the application,” said the agency, through lawyer Mohammed Adow. Omollo had petitioned the court to release to her Sh6.8 million monthly from her frozen accounts, arguing she cannot meet her family’s food, housing, school needs and the maintenance of her three vehicles. This is after late last year the court froze 10 accounts in Equity Bank and Diamond Trust Bank with Sh33.1 million belonging to Omollo and her children on suspicion they were used as conduits for millions of shillings stolen at the National Youth Service (NYS). Omollo’s seven bank accounts had Sh20.6 million while that of her children Sheela Mbogo, Stephanie Mbogo and Shalom Kamwetu had Sh12.5 million. ARA had told the court that millions of shillings, including a cash deposit of Sh20 million were wired to the accounts registered to Sheela, Stephanie and Shalom. The said deposits were allegedly made when more than Sh1 billion was stolen from NYS through fictitious invoices for goods such as firewood and stationery and multiple payments on one supplier invoice. ARA in their court papers claimed investigations have revealed that the funds in question were acquired through unlawful activities and are part of the funds embezzled from NYS. “The Agency did not preserve Sh9,805,426.82 held in two accounts hence the assertion that the applicants are subjected to undue hardships, suffering and are unable to pay their expenses due to the court order is not true,”claimed Adow. The ruling was set for February 14.
