Vanessa Mwangi From afros, to afro puffs, twist outs and even flat twist, every woman with natural hair is always on the hunt for the perfect hairstyle. However, once in a while, you should slow things down to prevent breakage. As you are contemplating your next hairstyle, make sure you are practising good hair care. Trim often If your hair is tangling at the tips, then it is time for a trim. Hair needs to be trimmed every three months for it to remain healthy. Head to the salon once in a while While following DIY routines may be affordable, you need some professional help from time to time, especially when you require a trim. The right products Always go for sulphate-free shampoos and moisturising conditioners. This will help keep your kinky or curly hair from drying out. Products with plant oils like tea tree, jojoba and coconut are great for locking in moisture. The right application method When applying products to your hair, always go from the roots to the tip. This will minimise the quantity of product you use and define your natural pattern, especially when you’re trying to curl your hair. Satin is your friend If your hair is prone to drying out no matter how much you moisturise, get a satin bonnet, scarf or even pillowcase to sleep on every night. Cotton pillowcases absorb the moisture from your hair while you sleep. Always air-dry your hair Many naturalistas are weary of heat, and for good reason, because heat damage is no joke. After washing your hair, allow it to dry naturally. If you’re in a hurry and have to use a hand dryer, use low heat and move it in a circular direction so the heat is directed at one portion on your head.
