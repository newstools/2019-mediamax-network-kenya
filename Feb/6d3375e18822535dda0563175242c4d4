Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho National Treasury has accepted Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB) proposal to acquire a State-owned bank which it intends to leverage on to drive members’ agenda. LREB chief executive officer Abala Wanga disclosed the bloc had identified Consolidated Bank and negotiations to acquire the institution are ongoing. Each of the counties in the bloc has pledged to contribute Sh200 million to raise Sh2.8 billion meant to acquire the bank. Wanga said the acquisition of a bank was one of the five pillars which the bloc identified as important in a bid to ensure faster development in the region. He argued the development bank is important to the bloc because it will fill gaps left by private financial institutions, which are mostly geared towards commercial activities. “A development bank is designed to provide medium and long-term capital for productive investment, for example, infrastructure projects or industrial projects,” he said. Wanga said some of the economic transformations which the region wants require long-term finance with long maturation periods, which ultimately translates into risks that other banks are unwilling to undertake and would rather avoid. Devolution Cabinet secretary, Eugene Wamalwa, who graced the validating of the Regional Economic Blocs Draft Policy aimed at strengthening devolution, said his ministry will ensure that the policy is finalised before the Council of Governors. Wamalwa said the formation of the blocs will allow counties to constitute an office where regionally affairs would be managed. The mooted blocs include Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani; South East Kenya Economic Bloc; Frontier Counties Development Council; Central Kenya Economic Bloc; Narok-Kajiado Economic Bloc; North Rift Economic Bloc and Lake Region Economic Bloc.
