Local gaming firm SportPesa have made their entry into the lucrative Fomula One after being announced as the new title partners for Racing Point. The team will now be known as SportPesa Racing Point F1 ahead of the 2019 season that starts in Melbourne, Australia on March 17. Disclosure was made during their pre-season launch event held at the Canadian International Auto Show on Wednesday alongside a reveal of the team’s 2019 car livery. The three-year deal will see Racing Point cars retain their pink colour with BWT continuing as principal sponsor of the team, with the addition of blue SportPesa branding on the front and rear wings as well as the engine cover. “We are absolutely delighted to become part of the extended Formula One family. This partnership is very important to us because it diversifies us into new territories and allows us to reach new audiences across the globe,” said Adam Beighton, SportPesa company director. He added: “Equally important is the platform it provides us with, enabling us to stay true to our mission which is to build and develop grassroots and professional sport in the countries where we operate by bringing new opportunities to local communities.” This week has seen eight cars reveled with the Mercedes W10 expected to be the one to beat after dominating the turbo-hybrid era, winning 74 per cent of the races, since its inception in 2014. Both pre-season tests are scheduled to take place at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain with the first test taking place between February 18 and 21.
