Amos Abuga @Peoplesports11 National Police Service Commission (NPSC) CEO Joseph Onyango has challenged Kenya Police hockey team to reclaim the Kenyan Hockey Union men’s Premier League title which they lost to Butali Sugar last year. Onyango says the law enforcers should learn a lot from last season’s disappointment where they lost the crown on goal difference after looking on course to winning it. Both teams finished the season tied on 60 points but the Kakamega-based side had a goal difference of +61 to Police’s +49. Speaking after hosting the 2017 champions at his office last weekend, Onyango insisted Patrick Mugambi’s side have what it takes to reclaim their title and need no further motivation. “Surrendering the title to Butali last season is not something the boys were happy about. I talked to them and the entire technical bench and what I get is that they are more than self-assuring,” said Onyango. “Police and Butali have been the two outstanding teams in the league recently, so my counsel to the team is not to feel bad about not defending the title since we have a new season coming,” added Onyango. Police team manager Richard Awiti promised fireworks in the new season, promising rivals to prepare for a tough contest when the 2019 campaign gets started on March 2. “We are not promising that it will be smooth-sailing but everyone is aware that we will have to work very hard to win the title,” he said. Mugambi meanwhile, blamed Police’s woes last season to a loss of concentration towards the end of the campaign, promising to keep faith with the current squad. “The common stand is that we have depth is the squad and therefore not likely that we will be seeing new faces in the team,” said Mugambi. Butali and Telkom won the men’s and women’s titles respectively in the 2018 season.
