Bernard Gitau @benagitau Some of the information on  Form One students on National Education Management Information System (Nemis) contradicts the manual data presented by school principals, Ministry of Education has said. Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed said the ministry would start a monitoring programme on Nemis from Wednesday, to analyse and update the data. “We are going to have a monitoring programme for both Competence-Based Curriculum implementation and Nemis which has registered more than 80 per cent success,” she said. Education PS Belio Kipsang echoed similar sentiments, saying Nemis registered more than 80 per cent success, adding that the manual data does not match. Capture information Kipsang acknowledged that the ministry has not been able to capture information as fast as they were required to mainly on Nemis. “The information you (principals) have given us manually is now 80-85 per cent in terms of available information at school level but is not merging with the information fed on Nemis,” he said.  To address the challenge, Kipsang said the ministry would immediately issue a circular to that effect. “We will be issuing a circular soon in bid to give guidance on how we can fast track the process of ensuring all the data that is required reaches the ministry hopeful by the end of the week,” he added. The circular will be sent to county directors of education, regional coordinators and principals. At the ministry, Kipsang said  teams are working on the system trying to improve and fast track capturing of the information to make sure no student is left out. The two were speaking during the distribution of Batch Three of equipment to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) model schools across the country. Two weeks ago, Amina said 83 per cent (873,463) of the total candidates who sat the 2018 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam had joined Form One through Nemis.
