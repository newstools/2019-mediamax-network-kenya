Roy Lumbe and KNA @PeopleDailyKe A nurses strike in Nakuru yesterday disrupted services at the leading county hospital, forcing patients to seek services at private facilities. Hundreds of families flocked the Nakuru Provincial General Hospital to transfer their kin after the nurses downed tools demanding an increase in allowances that has not been implemented following an agreement  entered after a strike in 2017. The facility, which provides referral services to patients from various counties including Bomet, Kericho, Baringo, Samburu, Nyandarua and Laikipia, has been affected by the strike which started on Monday with claims of patients being forcibly discharged. Some of the wards at the hospital had minimal activity with some  of the contracted nurses and clinical officers  deployed to the casualty department to assist the emergency cases. However, the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Joseph Mburu said operations are still ongoing, adding that they have scaled down the number of patients being admitted at the facility. He denied claims that the hospital was forcibly discharging patients, adding that it has been a normal hospital routine for patients to be admitted and some discharged. In Bomet, the nurses strike entered the second day. The more than 350 nurses drawn from over 30 health facilities in five sub-counties kept off their work places and gathered in Bomet town to push for their demands. “It has become a game of hide-and-seek between the union and the county government officials responsible for health services,” the Kenya National Union of Nurses Bomet branch secretary Vincent Rono said.
