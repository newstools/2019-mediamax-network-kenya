Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe The High Court has summoned officials of the Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) to appear before it on February 26 for defying an order that directed them to call off the ongoing strike and allow negotiations. Justice Nelson Aboudha said evidence tabled in court proved beyond reasonable doubts that the union was served with a court order to call the strike off and allow negotiations but Knun continued with their industrial action. However, Knun deputy secretary Maurice Opetu said the union has not been served with the court order. Nevertheless, he said the union will  appear in court. The court issued the summons as Knun issued a new demand calling for disbandment of the County Pensions Fund (CPF), claiming  it had been turned into a cash cow by corrupt cartels. Speaking in Nakuru yesterday, Knun secretary general Seth Panyako said CPF as currently constituted was a private entity not open to scrutiny by the Office of Auditor General. Meanwhile, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers has called off their planned strike after a meeting with Health ministry yesterday where they signed a recognition agreement.
