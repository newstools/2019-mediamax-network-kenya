Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi A multi-billion-shilling deal between maize farmers in North Rift region and an international company now hangs in the balance. The firm was to deliver farm input to farmers and buy their produce. The uncertainty comes after some regional politicians, led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, dismissed the partnership, saying it would only benefit some wheel dealers at the expense of farmers. Mandago took issue with his political rival, businessman Zedekiah Bundotich alias Buzeki, for spearheading the partnership between Export Trading Group (ETG ) and local farmers. Access fertiliser The governor claimed the firm was working in cohort with dishonest Agriculture ministry officials to benefit from the Sh4.5 billion set aside by the State to import subsidised fertiliser. Speaking in Eldoret town,  Mandago said  farmers would pay more to access the fertiliser. “We feel that the partnership between our farmers and the foreign company  is not genuine,” he said. This comes after last Friday’s directive by Deputy President William to the Agriculture ministry and National Treasury to purchase subsidised fertiliser for farmers. Speaking in Uasin Gishu county during the burial of Leonard Yator, who was attached to former President Daniel Moi’s security escort, Ruto said one million bags of fertiliser had been bought and asked the two ministries to purchase two million more bags. The DP said the government would not allow farmers to be exploited over shortage of fertiliser, after it suspended supply of subsidised farm inputs through the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) over a procurement hitch. In the deal, the company was set to supply DAP fertiliser to farmers through their respective cooperative societies at Sh3,000 per 50kg bag and purchase their maize at Sh1,900 per 90kg bag. In the NCPB subsidy programme, farmers could access fertiliser at Sh1,800 per 50kg bag.
