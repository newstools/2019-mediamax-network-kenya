Paul Wanjiru @PeopleDailyKe Some leaders in Nyeri county have formed a group to advocate for the election of Deputy President as the next Head of State. Under the auspices of  “The Kenya We Want”, they have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to honour his pledge of s-upporting Ruto  when his term ends in 2022. Led by former Nyeri mayor George Miatu and Muslim community leader Uledi Madjid, they accused some elected leaders of rubbishing an accord reached between the President and his deputy before they formed the government in 2013. “We have been looking at the political situation in the country and wondering what are our leaders  up to. They all know what the President has been saying about leadership after he exits the stage and yet they have been advocating otherwise. Let them know that most citizens and grassroots leaders are not with them,” said Miatu. The duo warned those out to undermine Ruto that they will be surprised by turn of events in 2022. They said even if the Constitution is changed, Ruto should be supported to get the most powerful position, adding that most citizens were not happy with plans to sideline Ruto.
