Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe As detectives piece together evidence in the murder of Mary Wambui Kamangara, massive cover up has come to the fore, which points to a possible intricate web of underworld dealings manifested by the manner of the killing and disposal of the body. Investigations have placed Judy Wangui Mungai as the main suspect, and a cab driver Michael Githae Mathenge as an accomplice, who aided the disposal of the body in Thika. At the second crime scene, a dam where the body was retrieved, bedding, cereal bags and bedsheets that were used to wrap the body to disguise it as a luggage were recovered in a thicket at Gitambaya, along Kiambu-Ruiru Road. At the same time, phone analysis by detectives has revealed that Wambui’s widower, Joseph Kori Karue, also Wangui’s secret lover, was in Ngong and not at the murder scene as Wangui had claimed. “The manner in which the body was wrapped, dragged to the vehicle and disposed points to a clear case of premeditated murder,” said one detective. Investigators are keen to establish the relationship  between Wangui and Mathenge, who she trusted to help dump the body using his Toyota Noah vehicle, registration number KCK 968F. Last month, Kiambu Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo granted police 14 days to detain Kori and Wangui pending completion of  investigations. An autopsy result confirmed that Wambui died from nine blows to the head and sustained defensive injuries on her right hand. The murder weapon, a pressure cooker, is yet to be retrieved.
