Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has warned that his Mount Kenya colleagues will shoot down this year’s budget if the National Treasury fails to allocate funds to the tea, coffee and rice sectors. Kuria said Treasury slashed the sectors’ budgetary allocations and spent it on maize payments against the wishes of farmers in Mt Kenya region and parts of Rift Valley. “I vow that should Treasury fail to allocate the money, Mt Kenya leaders will mobilise our colleagues to shoot down the budget. We won’t mind the repercussions,” he said during a debate dubbed “Nditimurano”, aired by Kameme TV on Sunday evening. He claimed there was a protracted plot to frustrate farmers in the region by denying them funds. “I forwarded the Crop Amendment Bill 2018 on June 12, last year, seeking to provide that coffee be exported only in processed form, but Speaker Justin Muturi has refused to approve it,” he said. Kuria said some countries are importing raw Kenyan coffee, processing it and exporting it back to Kenya for sale at the expense of farmers “who do not reap maximum benefits from their produce”. “My bill seeks to prohibit the export of raw coffee in any form but not even Speaker Muturi is ready to hear me. It has taken eight months for him to approve the bill for members to debate,” said the MP. Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri recently said the government would study the proposed bill to decide whether it will support it. During the interview, former Jubilee vice chair David Murathe accused Kuria of running a malicious campaign against President Uhuru Kenyatta.
