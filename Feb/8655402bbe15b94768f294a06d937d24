A row is simmering between National Police Service (NPS) and officers following the disconnection of fresh water and electricity supply to Mbaraki police line. Officers living in the quarters have been left in darkness after NPS declined to clear a Sh10 million electricity bill owed Kenya Power. Police officers, who sought anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the press, claimed the power disconnection was an attempt to evict them from the government houses despite a court order barring the move. Coast regional police commander Marcus Ochola said the officers should vacate the police quarters rented for them by NPS following expiry of the February 1 deadline. He questioned why officers, who were paid house allowances, had continued to live in government houses. Ochola said police officers, who are not ready to comply with the earlier directive, should begin paying for the houses at the market rate. “If an officer has been provided with an allowance to enable him/her to get an alternative house, why one would continue clinging to free things. It’s high time the officers began to foot their electricity and water bills as well as pay rent,” he said.  Some of the officers vowed they would not vacate the houses, saying their house allowances were too little.
