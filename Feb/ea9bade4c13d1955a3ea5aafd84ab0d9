Shabana finally got its groove back in the National Super League following a 4-1 whitewash of Kenya Police to end their poor run of form. The victory, which came against the backdrop of a seven-match winless streak, meant Tore Bobe leapt to seventh on the table standings with 19 points. Incidentally, they are tied with Police on the same points but enjoy a superior goal difference. The past few weeks have seen several off field issues bedevil the club but that was put to the back burner at the weekend to the delight of coach Andrew Kanuli. “This is a big relief and it gives us belief. We will continue to work and hopefully deliver positive results. It has been a difficult period but the players have to remain professional all the way,” said Kanuli after posting their sixth win in 13 matches. Meanwhile, Wazito have overtaken Ushuru at the apex of the 20-team table albeit by a single point. Their 2-1 victory over newcomers Fortune Sacco saw them move to 31 points, taking advantage of the taxmen’s 1-1 draw with visiting Kisumu Allstars. “The challenge remains consistency because as it stands, the journey is still long,” said Wazito coach Mohammed Mchulla. The dark horses of FC Talanta and Nairobi Stima are five points off the pace after draws against Nairobi City Stars and St Joseph’s Youth respectively at the weekend. It was also a week that saw struggling Kibera Black Stars earn their first win, a 1-0 victory over of the campaign over Green Commandoes.
