Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The contest for the national business lobby group has intensified after the second candidate withdrew from the race in favour of Nairobi Chapter Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kncci) chairman Richard Ngatia. Laban Onditi Rao stepped down barely a week after Kncci chairman for membership and resource mobilisation Stephen Mbugua also resigned from the contest and declared his support for Ngatia. “I like stability within the chamber for national good. I did not complete my term as the National vice-chairman and therefore, felt that I need to complete my term. The chamber requires visionary leaders and Ngatia has contributed to the growth of the chamber. I support him. In future, I will decide whether to run for the position or not,” said Onditi. On his part, while declaring withdrawal of his candidature, Mbugua said unity and growth of the chamber supersedes personal interests. “I am resigning from the contest because I want the chamber to grow and be the best. I see Ngatia as the best placed person to undertake this transformation,” said Mbugua. Kiprono Kittony’s term as the national chairman comes to an end ahead of the polls slated for May this year. Although more candidates still have time to declare their interests for the chamber top seat, so far, Ngatia has received a boost from two of his competitors who have stepped down in support of his bid. He is expected to battle out with national vice chairman James Mureu.
