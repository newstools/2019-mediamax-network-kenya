The first Pro-Am was played on Friday, where Germany’s Laura Fuenfstueck emerged winner. The Fuenfstueck-led team comprising amateur Mamta Patel, Rhapti De Silva and Purity Mutinda carded 58nett. Kitale Golf Club’s Wafula, who played in the winning team, savoured her presence in Vipingo Ladies Invitation Tour. “It’s such a great feeling to play alongside the top 100 ranked ladies from the European Tour. It’s a good experience and we have learnt a lot from the visitors. It’s my hope that similar tours are organised frequently,” said Wafula, from the ever-green Rose Naliaka Academy. The two-day event is a pre-cursor to a fully-competitive LET tournament which will be held in Kenya later this year, and which is excepted to draw the participation of ladies from the East African region.
