Macadamia Growers Association has set Sh170 as the minimum price for the nuts across the country as the harvesting season kicks off today. The Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) had imposed a three-month ban on macadamia harvesting to give them time to mature. Members of the association who had converged in Murang’a also want the processors to get the nuts directly from farmers. Led by their chairman Edward Mwiwawi, the growers said they are making efforts to do away with brokers who have for a long time been exploiting them. Mwiwawi said they shall have designated centres across the country where farmers shall take macadamia for processors to buy. This, he said, will enable them to have the bargaining power for their produce by selling it to the highest bidder. “We have set the minimum price for our produce to ensure we get good returns,” he said. He also said the processors should obtain a permit from the county government leaving all their details for easier tracking of their operations.
