Celebrated author Prof Ngugi wa Thiong’o has urged the government to set aside more resources and promote local language skills in schools. He said changing of the new curriculum, which is currently ongoing, presents the perfect opportunity for the Education ministry to include books published in local languages as part of the curriculum. New  curriculum Complete integration of the indigenous languages into the new Competence-Based Curriculum Ngugi said, needed adequate support from both the County and National governments in terms of resources allocation. “We need people who are great innovators and researchers in the society. Let the government channel more resources towards the realisation of this course,” he said at Maseno University in Kisumu county yesterday when he officiated the launch of ‘Somo Ber’, a book in Dholuo that is part of the series of books by East Africa Educational Publishers (EAEP). He regretted that the introduction of the foreign languages was quickly eroding native dialects in the country.
