Members of Utheri Wa Lari land buying company in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, have urged the government to help them take control of  22,000 acres of land they bought 40 years ago. In a petition to Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i, the shareholders said they were yet to benefit from the vast farm owing to encroachment by herders. They claimed that over the years, 10 farmers and workers have been killed while working on the land, which has remained undeveloped. The appeal comes barely a week after suspected Maasai youths allegedly mowed down a castor plantation worth millions of shillings. Addressing the press, chairman of the land company Stephen Muiru said farmers had title deeds for the land after winning a protracted court case four years ago. He, however, lamented that the farmers could not access the land owing to the attacks and encroachment by pastoralists. “We are calling on Matiang’i to intervene and allow grannies, who have waited for more than 40 years, to benefit from this land,” he said. Muiru claimed a plan to construct a police station on the land was thwarted by morans, who attacked CDF officials visiting the proposed site, and seriously injured two of them. Farm secretary Ndung’u Njihia said their titles deeds had been rendered useless despite being legally issued by the government. Meanwhile, the government has issued a one-week vacate notice to youths, who have invaded private farms in Ndabibi area, Naivasha. Naivasha sub-county assistant commissioner John Opondo said the youths had invaded the farms in Kasondia, ADC and Mwana Mwireri areas, thereby, causing tension. “Some leaders are misusing the youths to invade private farms in this area and we are warning them that they will be arrested and prosecuted if they don’t move out,” he said.
