Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The search for the missing human rights defender Caroline Mwatha who went missing almost a week ago has been extended to mortuaries, forests and rivers amid hope by family members of finding their kin alive. At the same time Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko offered a Sh300,000 cash reward for anyone with information on  Mwatha. Sonko appealed to anyone with details to contact the nearest police station or the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. Phone off For the better part of yesterday, Mwatha’s family and Dandora Community Justice Centre members alongside other lobbyists went to Karura Forest, Nairobi River and Ngong Forest. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives are seeking to conduct phone exploitation to establish the location where the phone was switched off and the last communication she made. At least three people from the Dandora Justice Centre who were in touch with Mwatha were summoned and recorded statements at Buru Buru CID offices to help detectives piece together her last minutes account before she disappeared. Efforts to trace her in city hospitals proved futile. Among the search team include Dandora Justice Centre coordinator Wilfred Olal and Mwatha’s father Stanislas Mbai. “We have organised teams to go to Karura Forest, Ngong and Nairobi River. We hope to get her alive. The police have fully taken up the matter,” Olal said.
