He is best known for producing killer beats at ItsMajic and churning big gospel tunes, but when Majic Mike, as he is commonly referred to, is not doing anything musical, heâ€™s busy in his kitchen. Just last year, the producer opened an Instagram account titled @mikeskitchenke, where he shares his own recipes. He taught us one of his latest ones; stir-fry calamari. Ingredients Squid (calamari) Vegetable oil 2 tsp Chilies (desired quantity) White onion diced Garlic pounded Red, yellow and green bell peppers julienne chopped Carrots strip-sliced Salt to taste Black pepper pinch Parsley chopped Method Heat your skillet and add vegetable oil. Add the chilies, onion, and garlic, and cook for a minute. Put in the bell peppers and carrot and cook for three minutes. Add squid and cook for one and a half minutes. Be careful not to overcook it, otherwise it turns rubbery. Season with salt and pepper as desired. Finally, add the parsley, stir and remove from heat immediately.
