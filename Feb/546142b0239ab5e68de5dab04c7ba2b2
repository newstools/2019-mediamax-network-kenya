Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Three Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) officials  were yesterday arrested in connection with a scam involving a Sh4.3 billion contract for the construction of a warehouse in Nairobi. Two of the officials are from the procurement department while one is from the legal department. They are accused of altering the tender documents to favour some bidders. The three were grilled at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters. Kemsa Chief Executive Officer John Manjari denied knowledge of the arrests. “I have not been arrested and I am not aware of any officer who has been arrested. There has been no request from the DCI on any matter,” Manjari told People Daily on phone. People Daily established the DCI had previously requested information regarding construction of the warehouse whose tender was controversially awarded. Indian firm Vaghjiyani Enterprises was issued with award letter but it was immediately challenged by Central Electrical Limited which told the review board and Appeals Board, that the tender document contents were altered after the bids were opened in contravention of the law. Vaghjiyani Enterprises had submitted a tender price of Sh3.07 billion compared to EPCO’s Sh3.09 billion. Jilk Construction had quoted Sh3.4 billion.
