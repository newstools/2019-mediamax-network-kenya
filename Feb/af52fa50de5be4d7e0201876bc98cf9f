George Kebaso @Morarak A series of text messages, both on WhatsApp and numerous Facebook updates show slain businesswoman Mary Wambui was a depressed and pained at heart hours before she met her death. Further, an emotional video clip to her estranged husband Joseph Kori begging him to give her an audience to discuss the way forward for the sake of their two children is another testimony that it was a disintegrating marriage. On November 10, for instance, she wrote to him on WhatsApp: “Soften your heart pliz and let’s talk it won’t cost us anything to talk and clear out the air….don’t do it for me or even yourself just do it for the gals.” “Have you ever heard of a mum taking poisonand giving it to her children wanakufa wote…. I’m not saying that’s what I will do but be careful depression is real….nimekubali hunitaki tena but you don’t have to treat me like s@#t twaweza achana kwa usuri without disrespecting each other.” In the numerous WhatsApp messages the People Daily has obtained, the slain woman is seen trying to use all the last strategies to have her husband turned murderer according to police charge sheet, go home and discuss the way forward. Detectives have accused Kori, a tycoon of working with Judy Wangui, a woman he was having an affair with, to kill his wife. Wambui is said to have run a hardware where she employed Wangui before the latter and Kori allegedly started having an illicit affair.
