Meru farmers have a reason to smile after a non-governmental organisation pledged to insure their products for compensation in case of poor yields. One Acre Fund, at the weekend said they are working with National and County governments to ensure the programme benefits farmers across the country. Speaking at Kiamakaoro MCK church in Imenti Central, a representative of the group, Winnie Akiso, said many farmers are incurring huge production losses because of climate change. While issuing certified seeds and subsidised fertiliser to 4,000 farmers, the lobby urged the farmers to diversify crops to avoid incurring losses. Akiso said the project will complement President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda on food security. She called for water provision in the area to enhance irrigation.
