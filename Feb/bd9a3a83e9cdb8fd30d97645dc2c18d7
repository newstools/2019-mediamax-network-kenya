Kiambu County government has less than two weeks to present a plan on how it intends to seal corruption loopholes to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). The ultimatum comes after a Corruption Risk Assessment (CRA) team from EACC handed over its findings into the systems, policies, procedures and practices of the county executive which established numerous illegalities and irregularities. Assessment exercise of the county was carried out between  December 5 and December 20, 2017 and found that the devolved unit does not have controlled revenue collection measures. This was three months after former Governor William Kabogo handed over the county leadership to Ferdinand Waititu with the report capturing Kabogo’s tenure at length. For instance, in the period between July 1 and December 8, 2016, over Sh320 million was collected as compared to Sh185 million in the same period in the year 2017. This shows there was a decline of revenue by  Sh135 million which affected the county budget implementation. The assessment gathered that revenue collection staff  failed to remit millions of shillings. In a letter reference number KCG/FEP/HRM/VOL1/17 dated January, 2017, a member of staff was disciplined for failing to remit Sh1 million which was collected from  May 11 to June 30, 2016. The team also noted variances in the county executive pay roll for successive months with the same lacking reconciliation to explain the variances which led to embezzlement of county funds. Report was presented to Waititu by the EACC vice chair Sophia Lepuchirit who  called upon the county government to lay a firm foundation for corruption prevention. The county was told to operationalise an independent corruption prevention committee and also establish corruption reporting channels. Waititu warned his staff against corruption noting that those caught engaging in the vice would be held personally liable.
