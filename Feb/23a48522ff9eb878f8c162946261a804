Hillary Mageka @PeopleDailyKe Senators are headed for  confrontation with governors over a proposed bill that seeks to strip them of some of their  powers and give them to county residents. The Senate Finance and Budget Committee has drafted a bill to empower the public by giving it powers to identify projects to be implemented in counties. The County Wards (Equitable Development) Bill, 2018, which was published in the last session of Parliament, envisages providing a framework for the promotion of equitable growth in the wards. But the proposed legislation is likely to escalate the supremacy wars between the senators and the county chiefs. Senators are expected to scrutinise the bill after resuming sittings following a long Christmas break. According to the committee chaired by Mandera Senator Mohamed Mahamud, the bill will seek to promote the decentralisation of development within the counties by creating a framework for identifying projects that are beneficial to the residents of the respective wards and providing a framework for their implementation. “The bill seeks to address the wanton waste of resources and promote the decentralisation of functions and provision of services by county governments to the extent that it is efficient and practicable to ensure equitable sharing of resources,” the bill reads in part. Public participation Several findings have revealed that county and national governments have not fully embraced public participation in project implementation as anticipated in the Constitution. In the proposed law, the county executive committee member is expected collaborate with village councils in identifying projects. “The county executive committee member shall designate county public service officers to offer technical assistance to the village councils during the project identification processes,” the proposed bill reads. The Finance committee says  the bill will ensure equitable sharing of national and local resources throughout the country.
