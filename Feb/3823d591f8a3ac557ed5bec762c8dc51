The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) yesterday proposed a raft of changes in the Constitution, chief among them reducing the number of parliamentarians. NCCK said it had monitored the implementation of the Constitution and noted areas that require adjustment to enhance justice and governance. To lessen the cost of representation, NCCK proposed the number of MPs be reduced from 290 to 150.  It has also proposed the creation of the posts of Prime Minister and two deputies in addition to Office of Leader of Official Opposition. NCCK General Secretary Peter Karanja told a media briefing in Limuru there was need for the government to give Kenyans a non-divisive referendum. He said there ought to be firm principles to guide the Constitution amendment process. NCCK Executive committee said it had consolidated various recommendations as a draft constitution amendment Bill for consideration by Kenyans. “Kenyans will recall that during the constitution review process of 2009/10, NCCK and other faith-based leaders raised fundamental questions we wanted addressed before the referendum but unfortunately,this was not done,” he said.
