The Court of Appeal Friday ended a 40-year battle over 518 acres of land in Kiambu county, alleged to have been fraudulently registered to a company associated with late Cabinet minister Njenga Karume. Justices William Ouko, Asike-Makhandia and Gatembu Kairu have upheld the High Court decision that the land, now worth more than Sh3 billion, belongs to a womenâ€™s group under the name Mugumo Nyakinyua Company Ltd throwing out the appeal by former coffee pickers at the farm. The court has dismissed claims by 800 members of the Gitamaiyu Trading Company Ltd that Mugumo Nyakinyua group acquired the land irregularly and fraudulently. The Gitamaiyu coffee pickers had alleged that Karume, who was once a Defence minister, used his influence to have the land registered in the name of Mugumo Nyakinyua Company Ltd, whose chairperson was his now deceased wife Wariara Njenga. Lawyer Shairi Mwaura, for the Karumes and Mugumo Nyakinyua group, has urged the National Land Commission (NLC) to immediately withdraw a caveat on the land.
