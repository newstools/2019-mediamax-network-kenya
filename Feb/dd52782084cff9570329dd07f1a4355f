Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho The Co-operatives ministry has added its voice to the proposed changes in the Cooperative Societies Act and the Sacco Societies Act saying if the amendments are passed, Saccos will cease to exist. Co-operatives Cabinet secretary Peter Munya said Saccos have contributed immensely to the development of the country adding that any attempt to change the act to include “Social Impact Members” would change the face of saccos. Munya said 48 per cent of all savings in Kenya are from the cooperatives. Co-operative Alliance of Kenya (CAK) executive director Daniel Marube has written to the Clerk of the National Assembly seeking rejection of the proposed amendments. Protect members Speaking yesterday during the launch of Export Development Programme organised by the Export Promotion Council in Nairobi, he said the government needs to protect members of the cooperatives from any uncalled for disturbances because the so-called social impact members will only vote for their concerns. According to the CS, Kenyans need to be protected from individuals who want to profit from hard-earned savings built in the co-operative movement over the years. The proposed changes were contained in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, 2018 (National Assembly Bill No. 12 of 2018). Munya’s opposition to the changes contained in the Bill comes after the CAK – the umbrella body of the co-operatives in Kenya also rejected the proposed changes saying they were punitive and illegal. CAK feared that should they allow the changes to the Act, they risk losing control and ownership of the 22,000 unions and societies with an asset base of Sh780 billion. Sacco members said the proposed changes are aimed at sneaking members into societies with the aim of gaining from their sweat. The group also took issue with the sponsor of the proposed amendments, saying they touch on the lives of millions of people. Ordinary resolution Saccos in Kenya own properties in various parts of the country worth billions of shillings. Part of the bill seeks to amend Section Two of the Co-operative Societies Act by introducing a new definition by virtue of seeking to amend Section 17 of the CSA by making the existing provision a  sub-section giving way for an ordinary resolution approved by the Cabinet secretary, to create a class of members referred to as “social impact members”. According to the proposal, the social impact members shall not be subjected to the primary and normal requirements demanding that each member has to subscribe, and purchase a given minimum number of shares in a Co-operative before admission. CAK chief executive Daniel Marube said according to International Labour Organisation laws, in case of any changes, governments need to consult co-operative organisations, as well as employers’ and workers’ unions concerned when they want to formulate and revise legislation, policies and regulations applicable to cooperatives. Marube said his organisation was not consulted on the proposed changes adding that the amendments sought are not minor by nature. “On the contrary, they have a potential fundamental negative effect on the co-operative sector,” said Marube.umpteen slightly silly aardvarks kisses Kermit, even though two speedy botulisms tickled Minnesota.
