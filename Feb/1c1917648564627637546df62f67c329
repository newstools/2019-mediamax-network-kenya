MARTIN MWITA Trade wars between the US and China could attract more financing for Kenya and other African States, a survey by global consultancy firm Control Risks has revealed. The strategic consultants in political, security and integrity risk says rivalry between the two super powers will play a part in how Kenya’s foreign policy is shaped this year. Control Risk predicts the US-China rivalry, will escalate with some African countries set to become the new battle grounds, as the two nations deepen their economic influence on the continent. Through the Risk Map 2019 report, they note that while the US is the biggest investor in Africa, China has made major inroads over the last decade, especially in infrastructure development, with Kenya being among the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese loans and investment such as the Standard Gauge Railway. Analysts at Control Risks say that Washington is likely to intensify its focus on infrastructure in 2019, bringing the war with China to the African door step. “So far, the US-China rivalry that dominated global headlines last year has played out less visibly in Africa than on other continents” said Senior Partner, Daniel Heal for Control Risks, East Africa adding that while support for China or the US has not emerged as a defining issue in African politics, this might change in 2019. “This year will see revived US interest in development finance on the continent and a more concerted US commercial strategy towards Africa is likely to take shape. The increased rivalry will, therefore, open up additional investment opportunities but will also present African countries with increasingly starker foreign policy and commercial choices,” he said.
