Fireworks are expected this weekend when 24 teams battle out for the 2019 Enterprise Cup title commencing tomorrow. The Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has introduced new format in the Enterprise Cup for this year’s competitions. The new format has seen an expanded calendar to five weeks, which brings in 24 teams into the competition. Of the 24 participants, 16 are 2017/2018 KRU Championship Clubs and the last four Kenya Cup teams as per the 2018 Enterprise Cup ranking according to the communication in Kenya Rugby Union portal. The 2018 quarter-finalists: Menengai Cream Homeboyz, Resolution Impala Saracens, KCB, Kabras Sugar RFC, Top Fry Nakuru, Stanbic Mwamba are among the top seeded clubs expected to participate in the Enterprise Cup. Others are Nondescripts RFC and Blak Blad  and will all get an automatic qualification to their pre-quarterfinal matches in their respective home venues. They will take on the winners of the preliminary matches. The 2018/2019 Kenya Cup leaders Kabras RFC will not,  however, participate in the competition and instead break for a brief holiday. Rai’s coach Hennie Du Plessis said the side will have a one-week break after Mwamba game last  Saturday to prepare for the mouth-watering clash against Quins on February 9 at the RFUEA Ground. “We have given the boys time off up to next weekend because we are not involved in the Enterprise Cup and it will be good for them to recharge the batteries for the reminder of the season,” he added. Nairobi hosts three matches on Saturday between Kenya Harlequins and Ngong Warriors at the RFUEA Grounds, while Strathmore Leos will take on Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture Technology at Madaraka as Mean Machine hosts Masinde Muliro University.
