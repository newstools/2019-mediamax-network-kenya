Marcella Akinyi COUPLE: ELIZABETH AND APOSTLE ALLAN ODADAH DATE: FEBRUARY 2, 2019 VENUE: NEW BREED CITY CHAPEL DÉCOR: KABERERE EVENTS INTERNATIONAL How did you meet? Odadah: I used own a boutique back in the days in town, I still do. My wife was up and about shopping and also visiting one of her cousins, who also owned a boutique in the same building. The cousin introduced us and that was it. How was your dating process? We never dated. I knew in my heart she was my wife, so we started courting immediately. Most Christians would argue that a pastor should not live together with his partner before doing a church wedding We’ve been happily married for more than 15 years after doing a customary wedding, and every time we planned to do a church wedding, something always cropped up and we kept postponing, but by the grace of God, finally we’ve done it. The church just has a new level of commitment and a breath of spiritual fresh air. Now we’re recognised by God, the church and the nation as husband and wife. When did the wedding plans begin, and did you enlist the help of a committee or wedding planner? We had both. The wedding planner helped us get vendors and the best deals, then ensured the smooth running of the process and reported to the committee. The committee was basically to help in steering the process. What was memorable about your wedding? I loved every detail of my wedding, but my highlight was when the pastor, Apostle Erick, declared, “You can salute your bride.” (Laughs) How did you settle on your bridal party? The team consisted of my close friends and church members. Advice to couples planning a wedding? The wedding day will come and go, but may your love forever grow. Also, in every argument, remember there won’t be a “winner” and a “loser”.
