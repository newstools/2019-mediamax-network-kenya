Jockey Leslie Sercombe controlled South African bred Fast Five fillie to ease to a solid win in the highlight GBA Fillies Guineas at Ngong Racecourse on Sunday. The 1,600m meet that was timed at 1:40:01 was tight at the start especially between the Onesmus Mutua and Patsy Sercombe stables but everything changed midstream. Richard Kibet jockeying Unforgettable and Muoki Kiilu riding Flamboyant fizzled off spectacularly as Leslie gave it a go with her big striding filly under good weather in the German Business Association of Kenya-sponsored event. At around the 600m mark, positions were swapped in quick fashion especially in the front row. James Muhindi riding Party in the Pack was in the middle of things with his Zimbabwean bred fillie showing true character amidst cheers from the stands. Patrick Mungai on Abby Rose was giving a real chase on the wide lane but at the final three hundred metres the eventual winner kept her eyes on the ball and cruised fastest to clinch home in two and three quarter lengths. Muhindi beat Mungai by a mere short head in the epic finish by the two. “It was a sensational race from us for sure and I am happy with what we did out there.Not taking away anything from the competition but this was a good day in the office,” gushed an elated Leslie after the award winning ceremony. Meanwhile in another top meet; 1200m Alibhai Sharrif Chilli Cup, Patrick Mungai atop Gold Pot played boss albeit with danger on his rear as he won the meet in a time of 1:12:08. He might have just crossed the line by a mere one and three quarter lengths ahead of Jacob Lokorian’s Quickfire, but had to be disciplined in the short race all through. Another duel ensued at the back with Quickfire just getting the better of As Paragon ridden by Kevin Ng’ang’a with the difference being a meagre neck gap.
