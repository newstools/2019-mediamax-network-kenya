You might have come across a pretty wine bottle with a unique shape and forced to decide whether throw it away or breathe life into it. Fortunately, wine bottles can be transformed into decorative and trendy crafts; thus, it would be a bad decision to dispose of them. For students of art at Mukuru Promotion Centre, repurposing used wine bottles has become a lucrative business. Collecting a bottle to make it beautiful is not just about art, but rather a way of bringing in money that could be used to improve the school in various ways. “As a school, we benefit through selling these decorated bottles, so we end up collecting as many as we can,” says Andrew Otieno, the art instructor. He adds that in as much as they may lack enough materials, they try to get the community involved in collecting and storing these bottles for the school’s use. “Some people think that you are wasting their time, so they opt to throw them away,” says Otieno. As for Peter Nganga, another instructor at the institution, art is natural to them and it becomes an easy task to repurpose the bottles. The decorative bottles are sold between Sh300 to Sh500.
