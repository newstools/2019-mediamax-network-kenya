George Kebaso @Morarak It is a fresh start at the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) as Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i  spelt out tough targets the government expects from the new team that was formally inaugurated yesterday. While launching the new NTSA board of management at Harambee House, Matiang’i said the government expects it to work towards reducing traffic-related deaths on the Kenyan roads by 50 per cent annually by the end of this year. “Our aim is to have better road manners and near-zero traffic-related deaths,” the CS stated. He warned that laxity would not be tolerated at the revamped authority as the government seeks to institutionalise better road safety measures in the country. The new team has also been challenged to make a habit of going out to the field to gather first-hand information on activities the authority is involved in such as issuance of car plates, issuance and renewal of driving licences, and inspection of vehicles, among other operations that fall within the mandate of NTSA. The six-member board has also been tasked to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the authority to ensure it aligns its operations with the government’s efforts. This is meant to establish a safe road transport system. Speaking after his first meeting with the new board, Matiang’i, however, exuded confidence that the individual qualifications of  board members match the task ahead.
