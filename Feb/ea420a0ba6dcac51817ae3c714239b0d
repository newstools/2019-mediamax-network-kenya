National Super League title challengers Ushuru are hoping to put their house in order when they travel to face St  Joseph’s Youth today at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. The taxmen, currently second on the log with 30 points, are firm favourites against the Saints but cannot afford to underrate their opponents. Last season, Ushuru struggled for points against the 15th-placed Nakuru side and going by their recent stuttering form, the taxmen could easily fizzle. In the last two matches, the former Premiership outfit dropped five points. “We need to avoid lapses and focus fully for 90 minutes. Nobody will be out to give free points so we must improve overall,” Coach Ken Kenyatta told People Sport ahead of the duel. Leaders Wazito on their part have a simpler fixture away at Bukhungu Stadium against lowly Green Commandoes. They will be still bubbling from recent good form which saw them pick six straight points. Green Commandoes, who are sitting dangerously in the relegation spot, has only two wins in the campaign against Wazito’s 10 are expected to struggle and coach Mohamed Mchulla will be going all out for a win. “We need the points and if we get opportunities, we will certainly utilise them,” said Mchulla who has the rampaging Kennedy Ayako, Teddy Osok and David Orem on call. Meanwhile, the chasing pack of FC Talanta, Nairobi Stima and Kisumu Allstars will be out to reduce the gap at the top following a weekend beset by draws. The former has an interesting tie at Camp Toyoyo against Nairobi Stima in what would seem a physical contest. Elsewhere, Kibera Black Stars who are off their first win of the campaign last weekend against Green Commandos will be hopeful to keep up the momentum when facing vastly improved Thika United away. At the same time Shabana who also ended their seven match winless run recently meet a tricky Fortune Sacco in Thika.
