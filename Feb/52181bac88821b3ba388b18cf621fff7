KNA and Noah Cheploen @PeopleDailyKe Five of the 40 street children, who were allegedly dumped in Baringo by Nakuru county authorities are still missing. Residents are now searching for the whereabouts of the five children who disappeared during the incident that has elicited sharp condemnation from leaders. Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri condemned the act terming it inhuman and uncalled for arguing that the matter could easily have been resolved through dialogue between Governor  Lee Kinyanjui and his Baringo counterpart Stanley Kiptis. Nakuru Woman’s Rep Lisa Chelule urged Nakuru county government to set up rehabilitation centres for the increasing number of street families instead of dumping them elsewhere. Ngunjiri’s remarks came even as Governor Lee Kinyanjui complained that more than 70 per cent of the children roaming Nakuru streets come from neighbouring counties. Meanwhile, a scuffle broke out in Nakuru Assembly yesterday after Lake View MCA Mburu Karanja failed to get the requisite numbers to launch debate over the “dumping” of the street children in Chemususu, Baringo county last week. Noting that the matter was weighty because it involved vulnerable members of the society, Karanja pleaded with Speaker Joel Kairo to allow MCAs to discuss the matter and those found culpable brought to book. But when the Speaker put out the question, only eight MCAs stood up in support leading to deferment of the motion. “You needed 10 to support your motion but as you can see, you only have eight therefore, it has failed,” Speaker Kairo said.
