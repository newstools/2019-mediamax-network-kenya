Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Bahati MP  Kimani Ngunjiri has called for immediate arrest and prosecution of Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui and his staff after county enforcement officers allegedly dumped street children in Baringo. Speaking at Jomec Rehabilitation Centre in Nakuru where he visited some of the rescued children, he said the governor was fully aware of the matter despite issuing a statement claiming  otherwise. Ngunjiri threatened to hold a demonstration in the county next week if those responsible will not have been arrested adding that it was inhumane for the county to treat the homeless children in such a manner. He bashed human rights groups in Kenya for  being silent in the matter.
