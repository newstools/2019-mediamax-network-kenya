Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the election of Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha. The top court dismissed an appeal filed by his predecessor Issa Timamy, saying it lacked merit. Timamy had claimed the Court of Appeal did not consider the scrutiny report, which indicated irregularities. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the argument, saying they did not find fault on the part of Appellate court and that they were right in finding the illegality did not affect the results. “We are in agreement with the Appellate court that the scrutiny report was considered and irregularities were appreciated,” ruled Justice Mohamed Ibrahim on behalf of the apex court. The Supreme Court dismissed all grounds raised by Timamy. “It is our view that the election was conducted in accordance with election rules and the Constitution.” Timamy had claimed that the election was not transparent or impartial owing to the undue advantage conferred to Twaha by his deputy Abdulhakim Aboud Bwana, a former employee of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The Supreme Court also upheld Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi’s win.  The court dismissed an appeal filed by a voter, Mohamed Mahamud Ali, saying it lacked merit. “We’re of the view that the will of the people of Changamwe was duly expressed. While there may have been imperfections in the conduct of the elections, they did not impede or affect the overall outcome of results,” ruled Justice Njoki Ndung’u, on behalf of the Bench.
