In a memorandum presented to the Taskforce on the implementation of the decision of the African Court on Human and People’s Rights, OPDP Executive Director Daniel Kobei said community title deed is going to protect the land from “abuse”. “ Those opposed are just protecting the big cats and their days are over,” said Kobei.  He said this would ensure  the forest is properly protected. “This thing is not new. It has been done in other countries like Tanzania and it is a success,” he said. The Ogiek community are hunters and gatherers who live inside the Mau Forest and  practise beekeeping. However, the community has repeatedly been evicted from the forest since colonial times. In 2009, the community filed a case at the Arusha-based court accusing the Kenya government of violating their rights by evicting them from their ancestral home. The court ruled that the government had violated seven articles of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights , which is intended to protect basic freedoms and human rights.
