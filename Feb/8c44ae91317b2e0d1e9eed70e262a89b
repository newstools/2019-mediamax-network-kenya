Harare, Thursday Zimbabwe’s President Mnangagwa has established an advisory council to help him formulate economic policies, reports the state-run Herald newspaper. A few notable people in the 26-member group are the newspaper mogul Trevor Ncube, fuel importer Kudakwashe Tagwirei and hotelier Shingi Munyeza. Chief secretary to the president, Misheck Sibanda, told the Herald that the council would act as Mnangagwa’s sounding board on economic reforms. Crackdown The article talked about Zimbabwe positioning itself as an international trading partner. But it made no mention of the current economic crisis currently gripping the nation. Bread has been rationed, and this month saw violent protests against the rising cost of living, triggered by a more than doubling in the price of fuel. Critics see it as a PR stunt following a crackdown on protesters. —BBC
