Bernard Gitau @benagitau Lawyer Miguna Miguna yesterday said he had filed a legal suit against Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) and Emirates Airlines for his deportation to Canada a year ago. On his Twitter handle, Miguna who was deported by the government following his involvement in Opposition leader Raila Odinga’s mock swearing-in ceremony in January last year, said the lawsuit was to mark his one year in exile. “As I mark one year in forced exile, I’ve today filed a lawsuit against Kenya Airport Authority and Emirates Airlines for unlawful detention, assault, battery, torture and sedation,” he said. The self-proclaimed general of the National Resistant Movement (NRM) was first deported in February by the government on claims he had renounced his Kenyan citizenship. Miguna’s attempt to return to the country on March 29 following a court ruling, which declared his deportation illegal, did not succeed after he was denied entry and deported to Canada, via an Emirates Airlines flight to Dubai. He later accused his lawyers and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHCR) of failing to enforce court orders for his return to Kenya. “Although the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) and my advocates have refused to enforce court orders in my favour, I’ll return,” he declared. KNHCR has been in the forefront in lodging petitions in court to have the lawyer return home. Several lawyers including Nelson Havi, Otiende Amollo, Siaya senator James Orengo, Cliff Ombetaand John Khamiwa represented the outspoken advocate, and succeeded in extracting the orders to have him allowed to return to Kenya. The orders also asserted that citizenship by birth cannot be lost by acquiring the citizenship of another country.In December, the High Court ordered Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i and Immigration Permanent Secretary Gordon Kihalangwa to pay Miguna Sh7.2 million for deporting him.
