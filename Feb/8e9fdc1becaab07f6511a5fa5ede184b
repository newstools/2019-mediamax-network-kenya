Clement Kamau and Oliver Musembi @PeopleDailyKe National Assembly Health committee chairperson Sabina Chege says she is satisfied with services being offered at the Kiambu Level 5 Hospital. Speaking after a fact-finding tour of the facility’s maternity wing where 60 infants were reported to have died in the last two months, Chege and Kiambu Woman Rep Gathoni Wamuchomba absolved health staff from any blame of negligence. “We have established that the medical staff are doing a good job despite working under extremely difficult conditions due to congestion,”  Chege said. The two MPs said the reported 60 deaths out of 2,000 deliveries were within the ‘normal curve’ according to World Health Organisation standards which is 45 per every 1,000 children born. However, the legislators said the maternity lacked enough facilities such as oxygen kits while several infants shared cots exposing them to infections. Appeal to media “I am appealing to our colleagues in the media to be sensitive while highlighting some of these issues as they could end up discouraging genuinely hard working hospital staff. We should avoid words such as agony, pain and suffering while reporting such cases,” said  Chege. Earlier, Governor Ferdinand Waititu, who also inspected the hospital, admitted that the maternity ward is overstretched but added that about half of the expectant mothers admitted there came from other hospitals following complications.
