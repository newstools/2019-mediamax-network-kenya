London, Sunday @PeopleSports11 Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku could get the chance to start when Manchester United travel to Chelsea in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Monday. Injuries to Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial means there is an opportunity for the likes of Sanchez and Lukaku to feature, both of whom have been largely restricted to bench duty under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The caretaker manager said: “It’s a chance for anyone who plays, if it’s Alexis or Romelu or who starts or [Tahith] Chong or Angel [Gomes]. “Anthony and Jesse have done very well for us, they’re vital in the attacking part with their attributes with their pace but then again with Rom and Alexis, they’ve got different skillsets so they will be able to show what they can do,” he added. Gianfranco Zola admits Chelsea are facing a crucial period in their stuttering season, after winning two and losing two of their last four games in all competitions by largely contrasting scorelines. Assistant coach Zola said: “We know that it’s a crucial moment. It’s very challenging, I think the key will be to face each task by only thinking about that task. The first one is going to be United and we come into this game after a good performance in the Europa League. It’s a good challenge, it’s actually what we need to do right now.” He added: “We know that we have to be consistent. We all know this. It’s important everyone knows the situation and is working on it, players, coaches and club.” Along with Lingard and Martial, who were injured in Tuesday’s 2-0 loss to PSG in the Champions League, Antonio Valencia and Matteo Darmian are also absentees because of minor injuries. Chelsea have no fresh injury concerns ahead and will give a late fitness test to Ruben Loftus-Cheek after the recurrence of his persistent back problem. Left-back Marcos Alonso could return after being omitted from Maurizio Sarri’s squad for the trip to Sweden in midweek. –SKY SPORTS
