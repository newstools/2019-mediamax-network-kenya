A taxi driver arrested in connection with the murder of businesswoman Mary Wambui Kamangara was arraigned in a Kiambu court yesterday. Michael Githae Mathenge, who is suspected  to have carried the body to a dam in Juja, where it was dumped, did not take plea. Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo allowed the investigating officer to detain him for seven days to complete investigations. Cornelius Arwasa, the investigating officer, had told the court that the CCTV footage and other evidence showed that the suspect was at Fourways Junction estate during the time of the incident and he was in constant communication with Judy Wangui who is in custody. On Tuesday, Wambui’s husband, Joseph Kori, and Wangui, his mistress, were arraigned in a Kiambu court but did not take plea in connection with the murder.
