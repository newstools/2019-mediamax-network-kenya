The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union has revived the fight with multinational companies over unpaid wage increments accrued from previous court awards. Plantation workers were to be given a 15 per cent salary increment but the companies are yet to honour the court order. At the same time, the union said it is finalising plans to file a case in the United Kingdom against the multinational tea companies for alleged injustices against local tea farmers. The union, through its national officials, said it has commenced a process of suing the firms for compensation of workers who have incurred occupational injuries and health challenges for more than 100 years they have been in operation in Kenya. It has sent an appeal to all former workers who may have incurred such injuries and work-related health strains while working with the institutions to list their names in readiness for the case. Union leaders led by national organising secretary Henry Omasire said nearly all multinational companies with tea estates in Nyamira, Nandi, Kiambu, Bomet and Kericho counties were violating rights of their workers. The leaders were addressing workers of Sotik Tea Company at Mokomoni in Nyamira county. They said more than 10,000 workers of different multinational companies have been dismissed over the last three years for participating in legal industrial strikes. They also protested extended use of tea-plucking machines. However, Kenya Tea Growers Association Sotik Branch chairman, Silas Njibwakale termed claims by the union as untrue.
