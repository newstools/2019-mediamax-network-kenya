Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has imposed a penalty of Sh166.95 million on David Tumaini Maena for irregularly trading in government or Treasury bonds. In a statement issued yesterday, the fine is twice the amount he received from irregular deals worth Sh83.5 million. “The enforcement action has been taken against Maena following the conclusion of investigations with respect to allegations of irregular trading of Government securities between 2016 and 2017,” CMA said in the statement. Illegal gains CMA investigations established that Maena, formerly of CBA capital, was a key player in the scheme and used his position as a dealer in the Government securities to obtain illegal gains amounting to Sh83,475,000 by trading ahead of his clients’ accounts in bond transactions that he facilitated as a broker. Maena has also been disqualified from holding any key position in any public listed company for a period of 10 years and or as an issuer, licensee or any approved institution by the authority. The matter has also been referred to the Director of Public Prosecution for criminal prosecution on market manipulation, Asset Recovery Agency to trace assets allegedly bought with the illegal gains and the Institute of Certified Investment and Financial Analysts for consideration of disciplinary action for gross misconduct. “Maena was given a chance to refute the findings but failed to do so.” In the course of investigations it was established that the fixed income dealers at investment banks, asset management firms and brokerage firms collude with bond custodians, mainly banks, to trade the instruments ahead of orders placed by investing clients (also known as front-running a client) for monetary gain. It was also established that the gains arising from these trades would be shared between dealers and the bond owners in contravention of the capital markets legal and regulatory framework.
