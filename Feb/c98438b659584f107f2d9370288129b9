PSCU President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday said he looks forward to the day Kenya will have its first female Head of State. While acknowledging that women are naturally gifted with attributes of servant leadership, the President said some of his best performing Cabinet secretaries are women. “I pray to God and look forward to the day that I shall be sitting and listening to the first female president addressing the people of the Republic of Kenya,” said the Head of State. “Some of my best ministers are women. Women understand the basis of servant leadership. Women understand that it is dedication to the family and the country that matters,” he continued. Uhuru was speaking when he briefly joined First Lady Margaret Kenyatta who hosted more than 2,000 Girl Guides and their leaders during celebrations to mark this year’s World Thinking Day at State House grounds in Nairobi. The function held at State House grounds was attended by Cabinet Secretaries for Education Ambassador Amina Mohamed and her Public Service counterpart Prof Margaret Kobia. He said Kenyan women, especially the young, have both a great future and potential and should always strive to bring out the best qualities in them without allowing to be put down by anybody. “I applaud you for standing firm, and holding on to the virtues that this movement has come to be associated with: dignity, integrity, service, leadership and patriotism,” said the First Lady who is the patron of the Kenya Girl Guides Association. She said she was proud and honoured to be associated with a movement that seeks to raise and empower girls and women to develop to their fullest potential as leaders and citizens of the world.
