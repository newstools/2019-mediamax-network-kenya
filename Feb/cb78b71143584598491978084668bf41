Bernard Gitau @bernagitau Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association (KYPA) has accused the Executive of snubbing the youth in parastatal boards appointments. The association, through chairman and Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, demanded an inclusive government that has space for youth. “The youth of this country have been sidelined in recent board appointments, creating anxiety and frustration among them,” Sakaja said. He said the more than 35 youthful appointment during the last parliament did exemplary, terming it an indication that young people have capacity to serve the nation. “Exclusion of youths and the current theft in public coffers are really affecting youths who are struggling with high rate of unemployment, we need better,” he said. Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said only few individuals are controlling and benefiting from the economy. “I propose we amend the law and make death sentence punishment for graft,” he said.
