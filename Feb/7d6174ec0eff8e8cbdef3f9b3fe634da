PSCU President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kajiado county leaders to work together to realise faster development of the county. He cautioned them against divisive politics and urged them to embrace one another irrespective of their political leanings for the common good of all citizens. “Competitive politics is not the end of everything. We have to continue working together for the betterment of our people,” the President said on Monday when he hosted a goodwill delegation of elected leaders from Kajiado. The delegation which was led by Governor Joseph ole Lenku, included MPs Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), George Sunkuiya (Kajiado West), Joseph Manje (Kajiado North), Senator Philip Mpayie, Nominated Senator Mary Seneta and Kajiado Woman Rep Janet Teiyan. Responding to issues raised by the leaders, Uhuru  said the government is committed to delivering its development promises to the people of Kajiado. He said development projects which the government is implementing in the county can only be achieved in an environment of peace and unity. “The work we want to do can only be achieved when leaders work as a team. I am very committed to delivering the promises I made to the people of Kajiado,” said the President. Divisive politics While cautioning the leaders against divisive politics, Uhuru said there are several ongoing projects, among them the construction of Ngong-Kiserian-Isinya-Mashuru road which the Head of State visited over the weekend. “What makes things difficult is cheap politics, but when people agree on what needs to be done, then it becomes easier to deliver services. We must ensure political calmness in order to develop our country,” he said.
