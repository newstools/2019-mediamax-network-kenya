Milliam Murigi @Millymurl Dairy co-operatives are set for better times after a leading milk processor launched a training programme which will see society officials trained on corporate governance. The processor, Brookside Dairy, said that the training would encompass topics on performance measurement and internal controls, to ensure that the co-operatives thrive in an increasingly competitive economic environment. “Corporate governance is a critical tool for sustainable growth of the sector. It is in our best interest, that the groups adopt sustainable management practices that would eventually encourage members to increase milk production,” said John Gethi (pictured), Brookside’s director of milk procurement and manufacturing. To ensure this is a success the processor has partnered with the Co-operative Bank’s capacity building arm — Co-op Consultancy and Insurance Agency — to train board members from 27 counties.
