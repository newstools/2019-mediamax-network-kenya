Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku has dismissed the Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report indicating the county is among those that did not use any funds on development. Ouko had indicated most of the money disbursed by the National government was spent on salaries, foreign trips, among other county expenditures in both Executive and county Assembly. But Lenku termed the report baseless propaganda meant to tarnish the county’s image. He urged residents to ignore the report saying the county government has undertaken hundreds of projects since he ascended to office, citing health facilities, water, road and ECD classes projects.
