Anthony Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru yesterday revoked the appointment of  Jared Kwaga, who is facing investigations over a graft-related case, to Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC) council. Mucheru had appointed Kwaga through a gazette notice on Saturday but yesterday, he revoked it through another notice,  raising queries whether persons appointed to State offices were vetted by relevant agencies as required by law. Kwaga, who operates Pasha Centre in Migori and other parts of Nyanza region, is one of the key suspects in a Sh2 billion graft probe allegedly targeting Migori Governor Okoth Obado. The law demands that appointees to State jobs be vetted by investigating agencies,  including Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) for issuance of a good conduct certificate, which cannot be issued if one has an active case under probe. EACC’s documents before court show that  Kwaga’s companies received Sh1.6 billion in dubious contracts that the watchdog is investigating. Kwaga and six others were to serve at the KIMC board for three years. Other appointees are Stella Onyiego, former Bonchari MP Zebedeo Opore, KBC chairman Edward Musebe, former NGO Coordination Board member Dee Kivuva Mutisya, former newscaster Beatrice Marshall and former National Quality Control Laboratory Board member Kagiri Kamatu.
