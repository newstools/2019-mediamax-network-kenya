People holding an Australian doctor, who was kidnapped near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in November, last year, have demanded Sh250 million ransom. The kidnappers raised the ransom from Sh9 million after the expiry a 14-day ultimatum they had given the doctor’s wife. Speaking on Friday, the wife of Faiz Alhamed Ali, who was kidnapped by three armed men on November 24 while heading to JKIA to catch a flight to Mombasa, said the kidnappers made  “the last ransom call” last Saturday, saying they would kill Ali if the money was not paid within a few hours. Ali was kidnapped while in the company of a  police officer, who had been  assigned to offer him security after several attempts by unknown men to break into his house. “When they made the first contact, he said he was being tortured,” she said. Ali works at Nairobi Hospital and was on leave at the time of the kidnap. His wife claims investigators have been of little help in the matter. “They want the money taken to an accomplice outside Gate Two of Wilson Airport. I have no money,” she said.
