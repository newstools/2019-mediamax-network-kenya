Irene Githinji @gitshee The government  is  saving  more than Sh5 billion annually under the new textbook policy that  it described as efficient use of resources to achieve desired results. Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed made the remarks yesterday as she dispatched 21,987 early grade mathematics learners’ books and teacher guides. The books have been adapted for learners with hearing impairment, total blindness, physical impairment as well as those with low vision. She said the books are adapted for Grades 1 and 2 and are also fully compliant with the Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC). “The Ministry is determined to sustain direct-to-school textbook supply as it has proven to be the best way to achieve the desired teaching and learning objectives in public schools. Procurement of these materials will be carried out in a transparent and efficient way to guarantee greater satisfaction among stakeholders,” said Amina, when she flagged off books to be distributed to public schools at MFI Document Solutions Limited.
