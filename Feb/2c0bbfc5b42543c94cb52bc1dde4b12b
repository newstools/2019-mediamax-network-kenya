Leadership row in the AIPCA church looms after a leader of one of the three  rival factions Archbishop Julius Njoroge yesterday said he had been declared the legitimate leader and registered under the Societies Act. The wrangles among three groups led by Njoroge, Fredrick Wang’ombe and Samuel Muthuri commenced after the retirement of Archbishop Amos Kabuthu who rose to the position in 2013 in a ceremony witnessed by former President Mwai Kibaki. Kabuthu stepped down in January, following a High Court order to hand over the mantle to Wang’ombe. The church held a national election conference January, 9, 2017 when Njoroge was declared winner but the two other parties contested his win. Addressing the press after a meeting attended by church’s board of trustee and  leadership representatives from all the counties in Thika yesterday, Njoroge urged faithful to unite and support his leadership as he is the duly elected bishop.
