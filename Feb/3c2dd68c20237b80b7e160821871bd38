Why this car? My dad worked on them during the safari rally. And this is actually my third one. You can almost say that I was born in one because I have always been around a Golf. This particular one I bought from the wife of a friend who had passed away. She was moving away and wanted to sell it and she gave me a fair price for it. It was actually built by one of the 2WD rally champions in Kenya, Deep Chana. He’s the one who actually takes care of this car while my job is to wreck it and take it back to him. What is the thing you love most about it? The engine is a Group A rally engine. It was originally an 1,800 cc, but was bored out to 1,900cc. It has a bigger fuel distributer so you do get a lot of punch. But the absolute best thing about it is how it sounds. While there are many louder cars out there, this is distinct and unique. What are some of the drawbacks? It’s an old car and old cars are fragile. It is my daily driver, but you don’t get the same creature comforts like you’d get in newer cars like air conditioning. Parts are not an issue as you can get them either from the UK or Germany, you just need to know what you are spending on and why.
