EMMANUEL MASINDE The much-awaited Kenya Women Premier League (WPL) season, which was scheduled to kick off this weekend, will now commence on March 2. The move was necessitated by the Women Premier League  clubs’ need for more time to make adequate arrangements for the 16-team unified league. However, the fixtures remained in altered as defending Champions Vihiga Queens will still kick off their title defence against Vihiga Leeds at the Mumias Sports Complex. Newcomers Nyuki Starlets and Kibera Girls Soccer Academy, meanwhile, will be up against Soccer Queens and Gaspo Youth respectively in their maiden top-tier matches. Just like the 2018 season, the league will comprise 16 teams, grouped into two zones with eight teams each. The champions from either zone will gain automatic qualification to the 2020 top tier Women Premier League. Meanwhile, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has affected the Sh4 million to referees officiating in the FKF National Super League, Women Premier League, and Women Division One League. NSL referees received close to Sh2.5 million in total, with their WPL and WD1 counterparts getting Sh900,000 and Sh600,000 respectively. This brings an end to speculation concerning their payments, with other arrears owed to them set to be settled in due course.
