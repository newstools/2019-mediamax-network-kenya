Hilary Mageka @PeopleDailyKe Some Turkana MPs have called for the arrest and prosecution of West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo for allegedly fanning violence in the protracted border town of Kainuk in Turkana county. Led by James Lomenen (Turkana South), Daniel Lodepe (Turkana Central), Daniel Epuyo (Turkana West) and Turkana Woman Rep Joyce Emanikor, the lawmakers condemned the ethnic clashes and urged Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to rein in politicians inciting the public. “It is evident that Kainuk is under fire because of political incitement by Lonyangapuo and his team,” Lomenen said in a press conference at Parliament Buildings on Wednesday. Emanikor called on State agencies to vet and audit politicians from the pastoral community to ascertain their social standing claiming some leaders are in a plot to expand their political territory through population displacement. Lodepe warned that political incitement could jeopardise development.
