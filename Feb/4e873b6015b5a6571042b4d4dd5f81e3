The wife of a top Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) official has once more suffered a major blow after the High Court dismissed her application to suspend execution of an order directing her to forfeit Sh19.6 million, suspected to be proceeds of crime, pending hearing of the appeal. While dismissing the application, Justice Hedwig Ong’undi of the Anti-Corruption Division ruled that all the recovered proceeds are at the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) escrow account and several forfeitures have been made and businesswoman Pamela Aboo (applicant) cannot be said to have no money without solid proof. “I find that the applicant (Aboo) has failed to discharge her burden of proof satisfying any substantial loss she will suffer, if stay of execution is not granted,” ruled Justice Ong’undi. In November, last year, Ong’undi ordered that the Sh19.6 million in Aboo’s three bank accounts  at Equity Bank, Donholm Branch, be forfeited to the State as they are “proceeds of crime”.  The judge observed that Aboo, who is the wife of Alex Mukhwana Khisa, a KRA staff, did not give any explanation of the source of the deposits into her accounts. It is suspected that Khisa was making the deposits to his wife’s accounts. The judge further noted that Aboo had a duty to demonstrate to the court that ARA cannot refund the money in the event of a successful appeal.  Aboo had claimed that the agency is not in a position to refund the money if need be.
