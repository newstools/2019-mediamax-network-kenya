Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) requires Sh3.9 billion to clear all the pending bills.  Of the Sh3.9 billion include validated legal fees used in the last General Election amounting to Sh469 million, legal fees for the 2013 polls, Sh1 billion, legal fees pending judgment at Supreme Court Sh81 million, pending bills at counties Sh18 million,  pending bills processed and exchequer not issued Sh1.5 billion and legal fees still under negotiations Sh659 million. This came on the day that it emerged that the country may be forced to spend billions of shillings  to buy new equipment to be used in the 2022 General Election as the current equipment are almost being rendered obsolete. IEBC Chief Executive Marjan Hussein regretted that the commission has not serviced the equipment for the last two years and thus they risk not function. Appearing before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee yesterday, Marjan told MPs that if the bills are not settled, the quantum will not only increase but will also have an effect on the operations of the commission including conducting the forthcoming by-elections. He said should the commission fail to pay, they will not only be forced to deal with court cases especially where negotiated legal fees will be taxed upwards from the initial fees but will also see suppliers withdraw their services and supply of goods that are meant to support the conduct of by-elections. “Due to lack of budgetary provisions, there will be accumulation of pending bills and commitments and the suppliers might withhold their services and ultimately the commission will still be obligated to pay for services rendered,” he said.
