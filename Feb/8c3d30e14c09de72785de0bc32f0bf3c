Reuben Mwambingu, Munira Mandano and DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Leaders have the duty to support the government in attaining 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school, Deputy President William Ruto has said. Speaking  yesterday during a prayer service at the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship of Africa church in South B, Nairobi, in the company of Starehe MP Charles Njagua, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa and Lang’ata MP Nixon Korir, Ruto said there should be no excuse of any child failing to access education. He called on MPs to assist needy cases through the constituency development funds. “We would want to see every child go to school because it is their constitutional right,” he said. At the same time, Coast Regional Commissioner John Elungata has directed administrators to embark on a house-to-house operation to track Class Eight candidates who failed to transit to secondary schools to get their details to facilitate 100 per cent transition. Elungata also challenged chiefs and their assistants to  ensure that children of school going age are not subjected to child labour or exposed to the risk of child sex tourism at the beaches. Meanwhile, Kwale county is still grappling with low enrolment for students joining Form One, despite a drive to achieve a 100 per cent transition. Speaking during education stakeholders’ meeting on Saturday, County Director of Education Jane Njogu said according to Friday’s records they had only registered 10,190 students.
