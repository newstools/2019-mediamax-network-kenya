Former Mayor of the defunct Eldoret Municipal Council in Uasin Gishu county William Rono says the chain valued at Sh5 million was handed over to the Transition Authority (TA). Speaking to People Daily in Eldoret town yesterday, Rono said the ceremonial chain was now in custody of the county government contrary to claims that it is missing. Rono served from 2009 to 2012. He said although he was never involved in the handing over exercise by the TA, he made sure the former Town Clerk Richard Chepkonga gave the gold chain to the authority. “I made sure that the gold chain was handed over to the county government through the Transition Authority before I exited from office after my term came to an end,” said Rono. He defended his former administration, saying that none of the assets worth millions of shillings, including the gold chain that belonged to the body were missing. “Before I left office seven years ago when my term came to an end, I ensured that all assets of the defunct civic body were returned to the Transition Authority for onwards handing over to the county government,” said Rono who unsuccessfully contested Kipkenyo Ward in the last General Election on Jubilee ticket. Rono said he was ready and willing to account for all the former local government’s assets and properties during his tenure in office to avoid any doubts. This comes in the wake of reports by TA whose term has ended that point to massive theft of assets and other property by some disgruntled officials.
