The contentious award of a multi-billion-shilling tender to transport bulk cargo using  Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) by two companies moves to Parliament after an MP expressed intention to file a motion to discuss the award. Sirisia MP John Waluke said yesterday he would file the motion seeking to compel the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to make public details of the deal. The corporation has awarded the Grain Bulk Handlers Limited (GBHL) and Autoport freight Terminals Ltd which is associated with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho family, the tender at special rates and also leased two of its depots in Nairobi to the two firms for free for a period of 45 years. GBHL is owned by influential businessman Mohamed Jaffer, known in handling of grain and fertiliser field at the port of Mombasa. Waluke wants to  know whether granting the lucrative tender to Joho was a way of slowing his push to have the port of Mombasa taken over by county government a matter which is currently before court. The lawmaker said he will be questioning whether the tender was floated for other players to place their bids as required for in law. “My team is already drafting the motion and expects it to be ready by next week. My request to the Speaker is for him to give it preference due to its importance for members to dispense it off,” Wakule told  People Daily at Parliament Buildings yesterday.
