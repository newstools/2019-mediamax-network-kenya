Philip Kamakya and KNA @PeopleDailyKe Two diplomats that were involved in an accident on Mombasa-Nairobi highway on Tuesday night were yesterday airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment. Brenda Mudenda (Zambia) and Duke Lephoko (Botswana) had been admitted to the Machakos Referral hospital after the grisly road crash on their way to Nairobi. Rammed car They were in a convoy of other African diplomats and were coming from the Maanzoni hotel in Machakos after a high-level meeting when a lorry crashed into their car. Mudenda’s car collided head-on with an oncoming trailer while that of Lephoko rammed into Mudenda’s. The two diplomats’ vehicles were extensively damaged and towed to Athiriver Police Station. Machakos County Chief Officer of  Health Dr Jacks Nthanga says the decision to airlift the patients to Nairobi was arrived at after medics treating them advised they be moved to a more specialized facility. The two are still in ICU but their condition is stable. The driver is, however, out of danger and is currently admitted in the wards where he is receiving treatment,” he said. Two other passengers riding in the same car with Mudenda, Wasa Kama and Joseph Guttu, both working with the Zambian High Commission to Kenya also sustained injuries.
