Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho The Government has re-opened the M-Akiba retail infrastructure bond in a bid to realise Sh250 million. Bond offer runs for 10 days from February 25 to March 8 and will be listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) for secondary trading on March 12. It will have a one-and-a-half-year tenure with a redemption date of September 7, next year. When the M-Akiba retail infrastructure bond was launched 2017, it fetched Sh247.75 million, less than a quarter of the Sh1 billion on offer. Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC) chief executive Rose Mambo said they encountered challenges when it was launched, which were as a result of lack of awareness about the product. She said electoral uncertainties also caused low uptake of the bond when it was first launched in 2017. “This was also a new product and we as market stakeholders have learnt a very crucial lesson from the report conducted. We are, therefore, more optimistic that the uptake will be positive this time around,’ she said. She added that the reopening of M-Akiba is aimed at deepening and enhancing financial inclusion through increased mobile phone penetration. The move will democratise access to formal financial systems for savings and investments, said Mambo. CDSC will facilitate the creation of CDS accounts, processing of applications in the primary market and shall offer registry services as a sub-register to the Central Bank of Kenya.
