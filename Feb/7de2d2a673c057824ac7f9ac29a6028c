Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) women premier league side Ulinzi Sharks are going in for the kill when they resume their league matches this weekend against high school students Yatta Queens and scholars Mt Kenya University (MKU). The military side took the December break on 13 points from nine matches, having won six and lost two. With seven matches remaining in the regular season fixtures, coach Yusuf Kipruto says they are targeting maximum points in the said matches. “We resumed training on January 21 and we are ready to finish the season on a high. We have seven matches remaining, with the inclusion of this weekend’s two fixtures and we are looking to bag maximum points and head to the Super Cup playoffs as strong contenders,” said Kipruto. The tactician will however have to do without the services of defender Isabela Wanyama who is away on military training as well as dependable centre Valin Akoth who is also engaged elsewhere. “The two players’ absence will not have a huge impact on our performance as it has come at a time when our injured players have fully recovered and therefore I have depth in my squad,” added Kipruto. In other women league matches, Yatta have another tricky clash where they face National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) on Saturday afternoon after the Sharks match.
