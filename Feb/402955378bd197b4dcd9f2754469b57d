George Kebaso @Morarak The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has arrested eight people caught directing sewage into Nairobi River in Kawangware area. Environment and Forestry Cabinet secretary Keriako Tobiko at the weekend directed that individuals, companies and public institutions discharging waste into Nairobi River be charged with  the offence. The CS said in a statement that pollution of rivers undermines the realisation of universal health and food security. The directive follows an inspection exercise where it was established that landlords and property owners in the informal settlement are emptying raw sewage into the river instead of channeling it to the sewer line. “It has been established that crops and water consumed by residents on the Nairobi River Basin is contaminated with raw sewage,” he said. Tobiko was on a fact-finding mission on the Nairobi River basin where he visited Kirichwa Kubwa, Kinyanjui, Dagoretti, Kileleshwa and Westlands areas, where the river passes. The CS also inspected the ongoing cleanup of the river which includes removal of sludge,   clearing of the banks, unblocking of water ways and re-afforestation. The project has engaged 600 youths on casual basis. The 42 KM stretch Nairobi River’s source is Kikuyu highlands, and it flows through the periphery of Nairobi Central Business area to the city’s Eastlands area.  The cleanup is an ongoing exercise aimed at restoring Nairobi city’s lost glory.
