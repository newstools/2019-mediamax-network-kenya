Some South Rift leaders and clergy have asked the government to resolve the persistent Mau evictions once and for all. Speaking after a four-hour closed- door meeting on Monday at a Kericho hotel, they threatened to move to court to stop  further evictions and to ensure justice is done for the  people who have already been evicted on what they termed as flimsy grounds. The meeting was also attended by former Bomet governor Isaac Ruto assistant minister Magerer Langat, immediate former Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyot, former Kericho Woman Rep Hellen Chepkwony, Myoot Council of Elders,  more than 20 religious leaders from various denominations and chairmen of five group ranches in Narok county. They criticised  the continued evictions and destruction of the people’s property and livelihoods by both County government of Narok supported by the National government agencies. “We ask the government to provide clear directions on the Mau issue,” said Africa Gospel Church Kenya Bishop Dr Rev Robert Langat.
