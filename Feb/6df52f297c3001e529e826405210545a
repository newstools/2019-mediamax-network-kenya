The Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi has been accused of fanning internal wrangles by sidelining those opposed to him. Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi told Mudavadi to focus on national issues instead of fighting members who had divergent views. “Mudavadi should act as the national leader he is, fanning small fights within the party will not work for him,” Osotsi told a press conference at Parliament Buildings. He claimed the party leader was behind the push to drop him as the party secretary general as well as all positions he holds in the National Assembly. He claimed that Mudavadi has also been fighting senators Cleopas Malala and George Khaniri over their stand on coalition matters. “The party leader opposed and disowned the elevation of Malala as the deputy minority leader in the Senate and Khaniri as a member of the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC),” said the nominated MP. On Tuesday, ANC accused Nasa coalition partner  ODM of political intolerance and bullying in sharing of House leadership slots. Yesterday, Osotsi who has been appointed to the House Business Committee to replace  Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba also of ANC, said  he was picked due to his consistence in articulating the party and coalition matters in and out of Parliament.
