Brusesl, Wednedsay European Council chief Donald Tusk today lashed out at Brexit leaders, saying they deserve “a special place in hell”. He accused them of causing turmoil and endangering peace in Northern Ireland without having a clue what to do next. “I’ve been wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely,” he said. Tusk spoke shoulder-to-shoulder with Irish leader Leo Varadkar in Brussels in a show of solidarity. Varadkar said the controversial backstop was needed more than ever to guarantee against a hard border reappearing. “I think events in London and the instability in British politics in recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last,” he said. The anger of the Europeans appeared directed at Brexiteer leaders such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage rather than at Theresa May, who is due to travel to Brussels tomorrow for talks on changing the backstop to make it more acceptable to MPs. But back in Westminster, Business Secretary Greg Clark warned  May not to string out Brexit talks “to the wire”. He said firms needed certainty within the next fortnight to prevent shipping being disrupted. Standing in for May at Prime Minister’s Questions later, her deputy David Lidington refused to give a date for the next “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal deal, saying it would be “as soon as possible”. Labour’s Emily Thornberry said the Government was “sleepwalking” towards the March 29 deadline.             -Agencies
