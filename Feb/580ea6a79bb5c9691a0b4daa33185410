One of the UK’s more prominent rapper’s Lady Leshurr was in the country for the grand opening of Muze Club. She took the time to visit different tourist attraction sites and hit the booth to lay bars with rapper Kingsko. A clearly elated Lady Leshurr shared special moments while in the country she loves. “She came for the club launch and when the opportunity presented itself, we hit the studio and it was all fun. Johnson Kyalo shot and directed the video, with the assistance of her husband. At the moment I can’t say when we will release the video as both parties have to agree on a few things,” Kingsko told Trendin.ke. Kingsko also intimated that the grime rapper promised to come to Kenya again for charitable causes, having visited the Nairobi Orphange, the Giraffe Centre and Kibera slums, where part of the video was shot.
