Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Four suspects linked to the death of human rights activist Caroline Mwatha will now face two counts of murder. Betty Akinyi Nyanya, Michael Onyonka Onchiri, Dale Richard Ramoya and Alexander Gitau Gikonya will be charged with the murder of Mwatha and her unborn child. The four were arraigned yesterday but did not plead to the charges because three of them did not have legal representation which is mandatory for murder charges. The court also found that the suspects were yet to be assessed mentally to ascertain if they were fit to stand trial as required. Mental assessment Justice Stella Mutuku directed that the matter be mentioned on Monday to allow time for them to engage lawyers and go through mental assessment. The four are accused of murdering Mwatha and her unborn baby  at Dandora Phase Four early this  month jointly with others not before the court. They are further accused of the murder of baby Caroline Mwatha Ochieng on the said dates. Mwatha was reported missing on February 6  and her disappearance reported at Buru Buru Police Station on February 8. Her body was found at the City Mortuary in Nairobi on February 12. Makadara Chief Magistrate Heston Nyaga had allowed the police to detain the suspects for 14 days because of public interest in the case and for their own security.
