Ushuru and Wazito’s stranglehold on the top two positions in the National Super League is now under threat as the duo are five and four points respectively ahead of third and fourth-placed Nairobi Stima and FC Talanta who are tied on 24 points. This is after leaders Ushuru, on 29 points, suffered their first defeat of the season, going down 2-1 to bogey team Talanta while Wazito, who have 28 points, drew 1-1 away to Kenya Police. Stima managed to get in top gear against St Joseph’s of Nakuru whom they hammered 3-1 at Karuturi grounds on Monday to pile pressure on the leading duo and with fifth-placed Kisumu All Stars not far off with 23 points, the title race is not a two-horse as it seemed two weeks ago. “For us going forward, every match will count and we must show up with the right mentality. In this championship, no team can be underrated so proper preparation is essential,” Talanta coach Abdalla Juma told People Sport after Monday’s victory. Another dark horse challenging the status quo is Kisumu Allstars. The lakeside team, under former international Francis “Killer” Oduor, has had a strong start to the campaign and just like leaders Ushuru and ninth-placed AP, have lost only once. They have current league top scorer Dennis Oalo, on nine goals, in their ranks which means scoring goals is not a problem as witnessed by recent wins over Shabana and Bidco United. At the lower end of the 20-team table, Migori Youth’s winless run also ended after seeing off Green Commandoes 2-1, giving coach Wilson Aol optimism that an escape is possible as they are now 17th on the log.
