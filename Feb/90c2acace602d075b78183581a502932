According to her brother Chrispin Chombo, a Good Samaritan found the 30-year-old medic at a petrol station in Bamburi and reported the matter to Kadzandani Police Station. She was later taken to hospital. “I was planning to travel to Nairobi to join in the search mission when I received a text from my sister that she had been found at the hospital. At the hospital, we found her unconscious and we took her to Jocham Hospital for scanning before returning her to the County hospital,” he said. Medics at Jocham hospital concluded that she was out of danger and that her unconsciousness could be as a result of shock. “Because she was unconscious, medics said she had to be admitted at the ICU,” Chombo said. According to him, her sister was admitted to the ICU on Sunday midday. It is not clear under what circumstances she arrived in Mombasa. Prior to her disappearance, Kilelu had reportedly been admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital for a depression-related illness and discharged on Sunday last week.
