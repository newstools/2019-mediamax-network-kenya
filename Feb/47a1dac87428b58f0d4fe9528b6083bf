Mercy Mwai and Zachary Ochuodho @PeopleDailyKe Public debt has hit Sh5.2 trillion – which is 56.6 per cent of Kenya’s total gross domestic product (GDP), Central Bank of Kenya governor told a House committee yesterday. According to National Treasury Annual Public Debt Management Report 2018, as at June 31, last year, the outstanding total public debt stood at Sh5.04 trillion compared to Sh4.4 trillion during a similar period in 2017. The report indicates that domestic debt increased from Sh2.1 trillion at the end of June 2017, to Sh2.47 trillion in June last year. On the other hand, external debt stood at Sh2.57 trillion at end June last year compared to Sh2.3 trillion at end June 2017. “Domestic and external debt accounted for 49.1 per cent and 50.9 per cent of total public debt respectively at end of June 2018 compared to 47.9 per cent and 52.1 per cent for June 2017 respectively,” the Treasury report indicates. However, appearing before a House committee, Patrick Njoroge  (pictured) said public debt has surpassed the 50 per cent threshold mark – contradicting what Treasury has always said, that the public debt still stands at 48 per cent. “The size of the public debt right now stands at Sh5.2 trillion representing 56.6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” said Njoroge. State reorganisation The governor, who appeared before the National Assembly’s finance committee chaired by Joseph Limo, however, said that there is room slowdown lending. According to Njoroge the current reorganisation going on in government will go a long way in ensuring that the economy improves. He assured the committee that this was the true position of the public debt.
