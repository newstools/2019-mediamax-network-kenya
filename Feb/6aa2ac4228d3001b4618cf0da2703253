Manchester, Sunday @PeopleSport11 Injuries to Ander Herrera, Juan Mata, Roberto Firmino and Jesse Lingard disrupted Liverpool’s 0-0 draw at Manchester United on Sunday. Liverpool returned to the Premier League summit despite being held to a 0-0 draw by bitter rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford in a match that was marred by first-half injuries to four players. At Emirates, first half goals by Alexandre Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitarayan was enough to see them beat Southampton 2-0 and return to their winning ways. After days of anticipation and excitement, the match swiftly descended into farce in the first period, as Ander Herrera, Juan Mata, Roberto Firmino and Jesse Lingard were all forced off injured, and the match struggled to recover from an entertainment perspective. The medical staff were rather less busy in the second half and that allowed Liverpool to increase the pressure, generally dominating against a United effectively playing with 10 men due to Marcus Rashford struggling with a knock. But the Reds could not take advantage, with United arguably happy to hold on to the draw which sees Ole Gunnar Solskjaer set a new record points haul for a manager in his first 10 Premier League games, taking him on to 26 points. After losing Nemanja Matic to injury in the build-up to the match, the first 25 minutes were nightmarish for United in terms of fitness, losing Herrera and Mata, while Rashford was also in pain. Liverpool did not remain unscathed, as they lost Firmino just past the half-hour mark having appeared to roll his ankle. Lingard – Mata’s replacement despite being deemed not fit enough to start following a hamstring injury – then seemed to aggravate that problem when attempting to round Alisson for the only real chance of a bizarre first period, forcing Solskjaer to replace him with Alexis Sanchez. Liverpool looked to turn things up after the break, but United’s defence provided an excellent platform. -FOTMOB
