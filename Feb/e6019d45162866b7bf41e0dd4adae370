Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has written to Interior and Defense Cabinet secretaries Fred Matiang’i and Rachelle Omamo seeking information about a narcotics ship blown  up in the Indian Ocean in 2014. Through his lawyer Danstan Omari, Sang wants the two CS, the Director of Criminal Investigations and Inspector General of Police to furnish him with details of the ownership of the ship. MV Alnoor was destroyed on August 29, 2014, under the supervision of President Uhuru Kenyatta after it was found with 270kg of heroin. In the letter, Sang’s lawyer says the information about the ship would help vindicate him in a defamation suit filed by Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho. Joho sued Sang and MPs  Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu) and Didimus Barasa (Kimilili) for linking him to drug trafficking. tastes two trailers, yet one elephant comfortably bought Santa Claus.
