ALVIN MWANGI Tourism Cabinet secretary Najib Balala was on Friday summoned to appear before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to shed light on alleged irregular award of Sh100 million tender for an expo in Nairobi two years ago. In a letter signed by EACC director of investigations Abdi Mohamud, the CS was directed to appear on Monday over the contract awarded to American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) Kenya, which hosted the Destination Expo Conference at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre  in 2017. “To our facilitate investigation, you are kindly invited for an interview and statement recording at the Integrity House offices on February 18, 2019 at 9am,” the letter read in part. He will be grilled by two officers— Francis Wafula and Kimutai Langat. Balala on Friday dismissed media reports that EACC sleuths had raided his homes and reportedly carted away crucial evidence linked to the irregular tender. He said his ministry was aware of the investigation, adding that it had been ongoing and he was cooperating with detectives. In its Friday edition, The Standard newspaper reported that detectives had raided Balala’s home and office last Monday. “No raids have taken place at my house as claimed by The Standard. The journalist was aware of this prior to publishing the report. My legal team is handling the matter,” the CS wrote on his Twitter account. Through the law firm Balala and Abed Advocates, the CS is demanding an apology within 24 hours.The CS defended the 2017 expo, saying tourist arrivals from the USA doubled in 2018 thanks to the event. “The tourist arrivals from the USA doubled in 2018 with 225,000 visitors due to the partnership with the America Society of Travel Agents who are the buyers of Magical Kenya as a destination,” said Balala. The  summons come in the wake of a sustained fight against corruption by the government, with several senior State officials hauled to court.
