Bernard Gitau @benagitau The Wiper Democratic Movement’s (WDM) Youth League has defended party leader Kalonzo Musyoka from attacks by a group of Ukambani leaders. Speaking at the party headquarters, officials led by executive director Jared Maaka declared Kalonzo the undisputed Ukambani leader. They also accused other Nasa parties affiliate parties of undermining the former Vice President and Wiper Party. “Wiper has been undermined by our colleagues and in a month’s time we are going to make a decision on our next political move. It will be earthshaking,” Maaka said. The leaders accused ODM of trying to hijack Embakasi South parliamentary seat, which they said, belongs to Wiper. “They should be ready for an epic battle and defeat which will cool down their bravado. Kalonzo is our presidential candidate in 2022,” said Maaka. The impending Embakasi South by-election has touched off a battle between Nasa affiliates, Wiper and ODM after the former handed a direct nomination to immediate former MP Julius Mawathe while the latter is backing Irshad Sumra, also a former MP. Kalonzo has asked ODM to pull out of the by-election. Meanwhile, Maaka has dared Wiper vice chair, who is also Makueni Governor, Kivutha Kibwana, to quit. “He is not sure of his mandate. He should quit and stop shadow boxing,” he said.
