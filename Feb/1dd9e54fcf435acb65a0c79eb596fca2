An anti-corruption court has ordered former presidential candidate Nazlin Umar to file a formal application seeking to be enjoined as an interested party in a private prosecution against Mandera Governor Ali Roba. While issuing the orders, Chief Magistrate Douglass Ogoti  said Nazlin should file her application by the close of business on February 25 together with her responses to the main application by a voter Simba Hasheem, who is seeking to prosecute the governor. He said the court cannot dismiss a litigant, who has sought to be enjoined in a case. Ogoti further said the application to be enjoined be argued on March 6. In the case, Hasheem wants criminal charges preferred against Roba and three other county officials, Ibrahim Hassan, Alinoor Mohamed Ali and Okash Abdullahi Adan. Hasheem claimed he has written to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) over alleged misappropriation of funds but no action has been taken so far. “The DPP has not commenced or taken up the matter at all, nor has he made communication of any progress,” he claimed. The petitioner said the DPP has failed to respond to the allegations and the applicant sent a notice dated December 6, 2018 over intended private prosecution. “The Auditor General’s report for the year 2013/14 was published online for public review and analysis and it indicated the loss of county funds,” said Hasheen. “This court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter for the administration of justice and in order to avoid interference, intimidation and hindrance by the respondents,” reads part of the application. Among the issues  Hasheem intends to raise is alleged irregular procurement of armoured vehicles at Sh16 million and the provision of ambulance services to Kenya Red Cross Society at Sh40 million. The governor’s lawyer  Issa Mansur  has said at the hearing of the application he will oppose the notice of motion as filed by the applicant.
