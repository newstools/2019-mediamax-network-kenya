Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Githunguri Dairy Farmers Co-operatives Society Ltd board of directors has refuted claims of being bought by Brookside Dairy Ltd. Board chairman Charles Mukora said Brookside Dairy Ltd or any other entity has not bought the firm. “Our attention has been drawn to reports circulating in the media of an alleged acquisition of Githunguri Dairy Farmers Co-operatives Society Ltd by Brookside Dairy,” said Mukora, who assured shareholders that the brand is intact and will continue to operate in the market as it has done before. Marketing strategy The board said no entity has acquired the Fresha Dairy brand, which was launched in 2014.  Fresha is the third largest dairy brand in Kenya and has grown from zero base in 2004 to its current position through an aggressive marketing strategy. In 2018, Fresha was awarded the Superbrands Award for its consistent quality and success in the Kenyan market. The society now employs 1,000 people directly and is a major contributor of tax revenue. Githunguri Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society Ltd is owned by more than 20,000 small-scale dairy farmers who are residents of Githunguri Sub-county, Kiambu.  Brookside, New KCC, Sameer Agriculture and Livestock and Githunguri Dairy Co-operative Society are the four biggest dairies processing above 100,000 litres per day. Other entities which process less than 100,000 litres per day include Kinangop, Meru Dairy Cooperative Society and Kabianga Dairy.
