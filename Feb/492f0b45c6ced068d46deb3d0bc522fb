Former AFC Leopards and Harambee Stars midfielder Nicholas Muyoti has today been unveiled as the new Kakamega Homeboyz coach. Muyoti who has had coaching stints with Leopards, Thika United and Nzoia Sugar now fills the position that had been left vacant after the suspension of Ugandan tactician Paul Nkata last month due to match fixing allegations. Speaking during the ceremony attended by players and fans, the team’s chairman Cleophas Shimanyula revealed that among the over 40 applicants who were interested in the job, he decided to settle for Muyoti whom he said was the most suitable person for the job. “Am pleased to inform you that the panel which has been sifting through various applications submitted after Nkata left, settled on Muyoti who has done a great job with our neighbors Nzoia Sugar as well as the previous teams he handled,” said Shimanyula. He added: “We have also brought in our former assistant coach Peter Okidi in the same capacity with Eliud Omukuyia retaining his position as the technical director together with our long serving team manager Boniface Imbenzi who continues to serve in the same position.” Shmanyula said the new technical team was to start the work immediately as sought to finish the league among the top five teams. He also lauded international striker Allan Wanga who has been serving as a coach cum player after Nkata’s departure and he managed to guide the team to two wins, two draw and one loss getting the team out of danger zone.
