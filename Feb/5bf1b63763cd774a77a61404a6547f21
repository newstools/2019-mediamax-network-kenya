Cristiano Ronaldo is regarded by many as one of the best footballers on the planet. And as a result, the 34-year-old forward is paid a pretty wage at Juventus for his services. But the Portuguese does not make his money exclusively from football, despite earning a reported £27 million (Sh3.5 billion) each year in Serie A. Here are 10 other ways he rakes in billions yearly 1. Nike (Sh100 billion) Ronaldo’s deal with Nike is a big one, and it is a company he has been affiliated with since 2003. Three years ago, the Portuguese penned a lifetime contract with the sportswear brand, becoming the third athlete to do so after LeBron James and Michael Jordan. This means the deal will continue even after he retires and earn him a grand total of £781million (Sh100 billion), according to Forbes. 2.  Castrol (Sh1.8 billion) Ronaldo first became involved with Castrol back in 2009, when he signed a two-year deal with the petrol company. As brand ambassador, the Portuguese earned himself a cool £7 million (Sh100 million) before renewing his partnership for another two years in 2011. How much he earned this time around is under wraps, but you can be sure the first figure was matched -if not bettered. 3.  ZTE (Sh514 million) Ronaldo signed a deal with Chinese telecommunications equipment and systems company ZTE in 2017. The contract lasted just one-year and saw Ronaldo star in some commercials with a phone and earn a staggering £4 million (Sh514 million). 4.  EA Sports (undisclosed) Ronaldo became the FIFA cover star for the 2018 edition of the game. The year before, Dortmund midfielder Marco Reus was pictured on the front of the box after winning a public vote. His introduction ended Lionel Messi’s four-year dominance on the cover and rather set up Ronaldo featuring for the next two editions. EA Sports has not announced how much Ronaldo has earned from being on the box, but you can expect it to be a seven-figure sum. 5.  Emporio Armani (Sh488 million) Back in 2010 Ronaldo signed a four-year deal with Emporio Armani, which saw him earn just under £1 million (Sh128 million) annually. The Portuguese was the face of the fashion brand’s spring and summer underwear and jeans collection in 2011, before the deal came to an end three years later. Interestingly, in 2013 Ronaldo launched his own underwear brand after seemingly realising he could make more money going it alone. 6.  Herbalife (Sh250 million) Ronaldo signed a deal with global multi-level marketing corporation Herbalife back in 2013. The deal lasted five years, with Ronaldo bagging around £400,000 (Sh51 million) a year for his trouble, and saw the footballer star in a number of commercials. 7.  KFC (Sh218 million) Believe it or not Ronaldo was once the face of KFC Arabia, between the years of 2013 and 2016 to be precise. The now Juventus forward earned just under £600,000 (Sh77 million) a year for the privilege and even starred in adverts across Asia. 8.  Clear Shampoo (Sh193 million) Ronaldo partnered with Clear Shampoo back in 2014. As a brand ambassador, the forward starred in quite a few adverts in which he uses the product. 9. PanzeerGlass (Sh100 million) Ronaldo entered into a two-year partnership with screen protector company PanzeerGlass back in 2017. The Portuguese was to earn a total of £780,000 (Sh100 million) from the deal, while the company use the footballer’s CR7 branding on their products. 10.  American Tourister (Sh40 million) Ronaldo became a global brand ambassador for American Tourister in 2018, when he signed a one-year deal with the luggage company. The Portuguese featured in an advert in January last year and bagged a cool £312,000 (Sh40 million) for his services.
