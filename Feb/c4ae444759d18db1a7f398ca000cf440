A  church service at AIC Chebitet in Bureti was on Sunday  disrupted when worshippers attacked each other after Bishop Silas Yego was finally recognised as the legitimate leader of the church. The service was cut short after a court order declaring the legitimacy of AIC Kenya Group was read to the faithful by the church secretary Wesley Cheruiyot. A fight broke out when the chairman of Bishop David Mbuvi-led group, David Rotich, attacked Cheruiyot cutting short the reading of the statement to the bewilderment of the faithful. Administration Police officers from Kapkatet chief’s camp had to be called in to quell the fight and separate the two splinter groups. Litein AIC District Church Council chairman Rev Jonathan Rotich, who was having a prayer meeting at Litein High School confirmed the incident terming it unfortunate. A church member privy to the acrimony in the two camps  told the press that offerings were usually collected separately for those led by Yego and Mbuvi. Police at Litein said Rotich and Cheruiyot later went to the station to record statements on the incident.
