It was proclaimed on November 3, 2011 by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s (UNESCO) 36th General Conference. The 2019 theme is ‘Dialogue, Tolerance and Peace’. Its objectives are to raise greater awareness among the public and the media of the importance of radio; to encourage decision makers to establish and provide access to information through radio; as well as to enhance networking and international cooperation among broadcasters. According to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, even in today’s world of digital communications, radio reaches more people than any other media platform. “Radio is a powerful tool.  And it is a personal, interactive platform where people can air their views, concerns, and grievances. Radio can create a community. For the United Nations, especially our peacekeeping operations, radio is a vital way of informing, reuniting and empowering people affected by war. On this World Radio Day, let us recognise the power of radio to promote dialogue, tolerance and peace,” he says.
