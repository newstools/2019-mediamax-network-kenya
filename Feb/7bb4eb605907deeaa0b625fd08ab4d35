He may be considered an award-winning artiste, but Nigeria’s Chinedu Okoli, famously known as Mr Flavour, time in Nairobi was anything but award-winning. From his pathetic attitude during his press conference where he kept journalist waiting for hours and not showing up at all. On the day of the event, dubbed Festival of Love, things were downright messy as there was a heavy downpour. That, however, did not stop fans who’d flocked Uhuru Gardens as from 8pm, from patiently waiting for his appearance. Local artistes such as Steph Kapella, Petra, Pendo and Sauti Sol kept the crowd busy with back-to-back Kenyan hits. That kept most of them around, however, the rains were getting worse. He finally arrived on stage at around 2:30am and his fans screamed in adoration when he performed his first track ‘Baby Na Yoka’. The crowd sang along to most of his songs including ‘Shake’ and ‘No one like you.’ The better part of the night was when he took off his T-shirt to the delight of his female fans keeping them screaming and in need of more. The event was, however, not one that could be defined as interesting or particularly enjoyable, at least Kenyan artistes made it worthwhile. Mr Flavour, on the other hand, arrived a bit late and performed for but an hour. That did not sit well with his fans and the rains washed out the remainder of the night.
