The Auditor General’s office Information Communication Technology (ICT) director Justus Ongera has lost a bid to block his prosecution in connection with alleged irregular purchase of Sh100 million Audit Vault Software (AVS), six years ago. Justice John Onyiego dismissed the application by Ongera, saying he was satisfied that there are high prospects of a conviction against him for giving misleading information or professional advice that caused his boss Auditor General Edward Ouko and the tender committee to single-source the software, which could not have been done if they had correct information. “Having held that the respondents (Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission— EACC-— and Director  of Public Prosecutions— DPP) properly acted within their constitutional and statutory mandate in recommending prosecution of Ongera, it then follows that the prerogative orders of prohibition are not applicable and the application is dismissed and interim prohibition orders issued on February 14, 2017 vacated,” ruled Justice Onyiego. On February 14, 2017, Ongera moved to the High Court seeking orders to quash the decision by Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute criminal proceedings against him, following investigation by EACC into allegations of irregular procurement of the AVS by Ouko’s office. Ongera also applied for orders to prohibit EACC from arresting, incarcerating or instituting any criminal charges against him on matters relating to the enquiry into allegations of irregular procurement of the software by the Attorney General’s office. Ongera was also seeking orders to suspend the decision by the DPP to charge him with an offence of knowingly deceiving a principal contrary to Section 41(2) as read with Section 48(1) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. The DPP had rejected recommendations by EACC to charge Ouko but gave the green light for the prosecution of Deputy Auditor General Stephen Ndungu Kinuthia and other senior officers. Ongera and the IT Audit manager Annette Mwangi were to be charged with knowingly deceiving a principal. During the plea hearing, the DPP, through Senior deputy DPP Nicholas Mutuku, said the decision to charge Ongera was properly and legally made.
