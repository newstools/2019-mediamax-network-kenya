Mercy Salisi @peopleDailyKe All road projects under Nairobi Regeneration Plan are set to be completed by July, Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) director general Sila Kinoti said yesterday. He said the Sh2.87 billion project, which covers 38 roads, all in Eastlands area, is above 50 per cent complete adding that works on the roads started in September. “We are doing road by road and I can say that we have done 50 per cent of the projects. We are optimistic that by July, all the roads will be done,” said  Kinoti when he appeared before the Nairobi County Assembly Transport Committee. The DG told the committee that the project was divided into three phases, with the first phase covering 30 kilometres road network, second one 25.5 kilometres and the third one covering 24.8 kilometres. Three contracts were awarded for the projects. He, however, said that the County Government of Nairobi, which was to contribute Sh900 million to the project, has only remitted Sh100 million. Kura was to contribute Sh1.97 billion towards the programme.
