Four family members died on the spot after a car they were travelling in collided head-on with a bus along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Sunday morning. The family was travelling from a funeral in western Kenya when their vehicle was involved in the accident on  Marula farm 10km from Naivasha town. A passenger said the driver of the personal vehicle miscalculated his move while overtaking, ramming into their bus.  “The personal car was in very high speed and our driver tried avoiding a head-on collusion but it was too late,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the driver of the bus had recorded a statement with police as part of their investigations. The senior officer said initial investigations pointed to speeding adding that the wreckage had been towed to Naivasha Police Station. “We received reports of the accident involving a bus and personal car and investigations show the cause was speed,” he said, adding that six other people were injured when the bus that was being towed to the police station hit another car.  The accident caused a major traffic snarl-up.
