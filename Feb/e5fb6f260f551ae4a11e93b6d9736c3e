Drinking has been our national pastime from the days of our traditional societies in centuries gone. Living your best life? Drink up! On the skids? Drink up! Weathered behind the wood, Mr Chupa has worked all over town and seen it all; crazes roll up and fizzle out, from smoked cocktails to rosés, Shebeens to Taverns, right up to the recent mixology rise, sheesha lounges and cigar bars. You possibly think that having an entertainment spot as your boardroom and mixing up trendy cocktails for a living is one long party. In some ways you’re right. But, in many others, you couldn’t be further from the truth. It’s not as chill as it may seem. First, you’re basically a chemist minus the lab coat. Imagine a dozen cocktails on the menu, each with a couple of ingredients, and you have to master these intricate combos and get it right every single time. It’s like sitting a live CAT, in front of an invigilator eager to get pissed. You also need to have the memory of an elephant, as you have to note the chain of impatient eyes trying to catch your attention. Not to mention, needing to make the acquaintance of your regulars and remember their names and favourite poisons of choice, and when they have overdone the latter that they can’t recall the former, call them a cab home. This is after they’ve inundated you with tales you could care less to hear about, or turned you into a psychologist and poured all their troubles on your counter. It’s a job where you just want to uncork, shake, stir and serve your clients their tipple then carry on with earning a crust, but more often than not, find yourself run ragged by their howling, when they get plastered and up the volume of their voices several decibels. I guess it’s going to be one hell of a boozy ride with Mr Chupa, beginning this weekend on our Uncorked section. Sit back and enjoy.
