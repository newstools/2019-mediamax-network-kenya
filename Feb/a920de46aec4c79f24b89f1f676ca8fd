Film: The Jungle Book Year: 2016 Age: 9+ Rating: 8/10 The Jungle Book is a live-action CGI update of Rudyard Kipling’s classic book of short stories. With its blend of live-action and photo-realistic computer-generated effects, this action-packed adventure, which was inspired by Disney’s 1967 animated musical and has an all-star voice cast, tells the story of young Mowgli, an orphaned “man cub” raised as a wolf and hated by the jungle’s most vicious predator, tiger Shere Khan. Mowgli is the only human co-existing with animals in the jungle. Found by the panther Bagheera, Mowgli was raised by wolf alpha male Akela and his mate Raksha (voiced by Lupita Nyongo), who considers him one of her own cubs, and the rest of their pack. But when Mowgli draws attention to himself while all the animals gather during a drought-provoked truce to drink water, Shere Khan proclaims his intention kill Mowgli before he has the chance to become a man and endanger the jungle like all humans do. The pack tries to protect Mowgli, but the boy decides he’ll save his lupine family by allowing Bagheera to return him to the world of men. On the journey to the human village, Mowgli ends up dealing with various predators and befriends a new pal, honey-obsessed bear Baloo. Meanwhile, Shere Khan violently punishes the pack for not turning over Mowgli and lies in wait for Mowgli to return so he can kill the boy who doesn’t belong in the jungle. There are several jump-worthy, intense moments, but on the upside, the movie has clear, strong messages about the importance of courage, teamwork, family and friendship. -Common Sense Media
