Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka The Ministry of Lands has refuted claims by the Nairobi County government that President Uhuru Kenyatta was duped into presenting dummy title deeds at Jacaranda Grounds, Nairobi, last year. Lands Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Gideon Mung’aro dismissed City Hall’s claims as “malicious”, saying beneficiaries got their title deeds while the remainder are still being processed. “We did not issue any fake titles as alleged. The President issued genuine documents to the residents of Eastlands,” he told the Senate Lands and Environment committee yesterday. The CAS said the titles that were given out were from different departments including the county Housing department, NSSF and NHIF. Last week, Nairobi county Lands and Housing CEC Charles Kerich claimed at a Nairobi County Assembly Planning Committee that the President had been duped into issuing titles that were not yet ready. According to Kerich, at the time only 50 titles were ready against the estimated 50,000 deeds.
