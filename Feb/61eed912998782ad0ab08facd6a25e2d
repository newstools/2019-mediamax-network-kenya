Facebook users have continued to rise despite a series of data privacy scandals and criticism over its attempt to stem toxic content. The social media giant said the number of people who logged into its site at least once a month jumped nine per cent last year to 2.32 billion people. Fears the firm’s scandals could put off advertisers also proved unfounded with annual revenues up 30 per cent last year. The rise came despite campaigns which urged people to shun the tech giant. Founder Mark Zuckerberg said the firm had “fundamentally changed how we run the company to focus on the biggest social issues”. The strong financial performance comes amid continuing concerns over how the social media firm handles users’ personal data and privacy after the Cambridge Analytica data sharing scandal and fears the network has been used as a political tool. The company’s shares have lost almost a third of their value since July when it warned about slowing revenue growth and they remain near a two-year low. But they jumped over nine per cent in after-hours trading after profit and revenue beat analyst forecasts. Facebook’s total profit for 2018 was $22.1 billion (Sh2.2 trillion), up 39 per cent on 2017. User growth was particularly strong in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, but flat in the US and Canada. Last year, Facebook saw the Cambridge Analytica scandal, political manipulation, fake news, data breaches and accusations of deeply unethical behaviour. –BBC
