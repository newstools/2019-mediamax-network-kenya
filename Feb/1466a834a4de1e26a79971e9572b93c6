The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has declined to withdraw extradition proceedings against the Akasha brothers and their two accomplices. Through State counsel Beryl Marinda, Haji said there was need for the matter against Baktash Akasha and Ibrahim Akasha to be heard and determined to enable the court to set a precedent on the way to proceed with extradition cases. The matter had been filed in 2017 by the State seeking to have the High Court overturn a lower court decision stopping the extradition of the accused persons. Marinda informed High Court judge Njoki Mwangi that they had no instructions from the DPP on the way to proceed and would be seeking guidance from Hajji. “We seek 14 days to consult with the DPP on how to pursue the matter. Its ruling will set a precedent for similar cases brought before the High Court,” she said. The DPP application came after the Akasha brothers through their lawyer made an application seeking to have the  matter withdrawn. The Akashas said the matter had been surpassed by the events and there was no need to pursue it further. The Akashas were handed over to the US by the Kenyan government after “it proved difficult to extradite them using the court process”. Judge Mwangi questioned the interest the DPP had in pursuing it yet the parties in the matter were no longer in the country. “Why should the DPP pursue this matter yet the persons were already taken away and another case in the US is about to be concluded,” she posed. Mwangi said applicants were awaiting sentencing and therefore the DPP should have strong reasons on why the matter should not be dismissed. Abdalla Akasha and his younger brother Ibrahim have been charged in a US court alongside Indian Vijaygiri Goswami and Pakistani Gulam Hussein with drug trafficking.
