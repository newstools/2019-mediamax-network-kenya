Ericson Kiprono @PeopleSports11 Kenyan athletes are still haunted by the disappointments of losing both the men’s and women’s titles in last year’s Boston Marathon and want to atone for it by claiming this year’s diadems. Desiree Linden became the first American in 33 years to win the women’s Boston Marathon in 2018 while Japanese Yuki Kawauchi claimed the men’s equivalent, ending Kenya’s stranglehold after Ednah Kiplagat and Geoffrey Kirui had won the 2017 edition. It is from that experience that two-time Boston champion Kiplagat is rallying other Kenyan runners to rise to the occasion and reclaim the title in the April 15 race. Kiplagat and Kirui return to Boston for another crack at the title and will lead a 15-member Kenyan delegation in the US city. “It is about time Kenya reclaimed the titles in Boston. Poor weather and other challenges saw us lose last time, but we have the capacity to challenge,” said Kiplagat. The Boston line-up features nine previous winners and includes six men who have run faster time below the two hours and six minutes mark. There are also six women with personal best times of below two hours and 21 minutes. With Linden out to defend her title, Kiplagat will team up with 2015 winner Caroline Rotich, 2012 champion Sharon Cherop and Paris Marathon winner Betsy Saina in a bid to stop her. There are also Ethiopian women led by three-time Dubai Marathon winner Aselefech Mergia, 2015 world champion Mare Dibaba and 2017 Dubai winner Worknesh Degefa. In the men’s race, Kawauchi will have Kirui and two-time Boston Marathon champion Lelisa Desisa, 2016 Boston winner Lemi Berhanu and 2012 champion Wesley Korir to contend with. Amsterdam Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono and Ethiopian duo Sisay Lemma and Solomon Deksisa will also line up.
