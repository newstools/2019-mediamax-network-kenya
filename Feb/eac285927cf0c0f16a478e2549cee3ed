ALVIN MWANGI Striking nurses on Friday defied President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to return back to work or face the sack. A spot check by the People Daily at various  hospitals affected by the industrial action, nurses kept off their workplaces, with patients left unattended. At the National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital, nurses were few. A nurse said they would not return to work until their demands are met. On Wednesday the President directed the healthcare givers to resume duty by Friday, failure to which or they would be fired. He warned the Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) against intimidating health workers willing to return to work. “As the Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces, I have instructed the National Police Service to take decisive action against picketers who may intimidate or otherwise harass public servants who intend to go to work,” he ordered. Meanwhile,  Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani   accused the nurses union of snubbing conciliation talks. “My appeal to nurses is to reconsider their position and return to work. The position of the government is clear: the rule of law must be obeyed,”he said. Talks between the Labour and Health ministry and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission continue on Saturday to end the stalemate. Nurses are demanding payment of uniform and service allowances as agreed in a 2017 CBA between them and county governments. Knun officials led by secretary general Seth Panyako and Kisumu branch chair Morris Opetu on Friday maintained that nurses would not be intimidated to resume work. Elsewhere, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli accused Yattani of misleading the President. He said the  strike was a labour matter and termed Uhuru’s ultimatum ‘unnecessary’.
