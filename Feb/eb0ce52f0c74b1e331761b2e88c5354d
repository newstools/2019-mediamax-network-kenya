Irene Githinji @gitshee Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has welcomed a proposal to have a staggered election for efficiency purposes, instead of voting for six positions in a single day as the law currently stipulates. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday said the commission would want presidential and parliamentary elections held on the same day while those of county representatives, including governor, senator, women representative and member of the County Assembly conducted separately. He proposed that the elections be conducted in three months’ time, saying the cost would remain constant. “Six elections in a single day resulted in fatigue among electoral officials. Some of the errors witnessed were as a result of such fatigue,” he said. This would, however, call for an amendment of law, which provides that elections for the six elective posts be held on the second Tuesday of August every fifth year. This was part of the proposals arising from the Post Election Evaluation (PEE) report for the August 7, 2017, General Election and the October 26 Fresh Presidential Election. IEBC called for staggering the appointment of commissioners so that the terms of the entire team do not end on the same date. The commission also wants to ensure all eligible Kenyans are registered as voters and made proposals to integrate the national citizen registration database with the voters register. Other stakeholders called for the need to sanitise party primaries process.
