Berlin, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has warned Bayern Munich not to let history repeat itself against Liverpool in their home Champions League last 16, second leg after a goalless draw at Anfield. Bayern earned the draw in a nervy first leg on Merseyside to put the German giants in a good position for the return at their Allianz Arena on March 13. “We have opened the door for the second leg a bit, but I warn against going into the return leg with too much euphoria – it’s not a result that is safe,” Rummenigge, Bayern’s chairman, warned. The 63-year-old speaks from experience having been in an identical situation before. He was part of the same Munich team as current president Uli Hoeness that lost the semi-final of the 1981 European Cup to Liverpool. In 1981, Bayern also earned a goalless draw at Anfield and Rummenigge scored in a 1-1 draw in the return leg, but an away goal by Ray Kennedy at Munich’s Olympic Stadium put Liverpool through. “We were eliminated after a 1-1 draw in Munich, so we must not make the same mistake my team made. We have to play very well in the second game,” said Rummenigge. Bayern put in a solid defensive display on Merseyside on Tuesday to frustrate a Liverpool side fresh after a 10-day break, but head coach Niko Kovac also warned they must finish the job in Munich. “Everyone was there for the other and you can see that if we have a structure in our game, it’s hard to score against us,” said Kovac.   -AFP
