Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Government ministries, counties and State corporations have been given one month to make public all tenders and contracts they have so far issued or face sanctions. The Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ), also known as the Ombudsman, has threatened to write to the national treasury to ask them to freeze their accounts on grounds that the departments have not been transparent with their work. Ombudsman chairperson Florence Kajuju also threatened to name public institutions that will fail to make public procurement information. “We are giving these institutions a warning that they have only 30 days to comply with this and make public all their information. If they do not do that we will use the powers we have and write to Treasury and tell them there is no need to release funds to counties because they are not transparent with their endeavours,” she said. Public Service and Youth Affairs Francis Owino said that the ministry will ensure that it implements the report including taking administrative sanctions against public officers who fail to adhere to the expected service delivery standards. The threats by the commission came after a report on the disclosure of information by public bodies ranked county government as the worst performers in disclosing public information. According to the report only a paltry 9 percent had fully disclosed information on their contracts, 36 per cent had not disclosed and 55 percent had partially disclosed. Kajuju regretted that whereas most of the websites had information on tender advertisements, they did not avail further details of the tenders awarded, contractors, contract sums and time frames for execution.
