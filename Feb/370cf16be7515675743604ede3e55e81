PSCU @PeopleDailyKe First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has called for an education system that prepares young people for today’s challenges. She said young people need a system that enables them to accomplish their dreams in the highly competitive world by equipping them with appropriate knowledge, skills and confidence. “It is widely acknowledged that today’s education systems should be preparing our children for an entirely different world from which we, as parents, experienced,” said the First Lady. She was speaking yesterday  at Brookhouse School-Runda Campus during a ceremony to officially open the school’s library and commissioning of a scholarship programme. During the ceremony, top candidates in the 2017 and 2018 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations Goldalyn Tanga and Olive Wachira were awarded the Margaret Kenyatta Scholarship for their secondary education in the school. The First Lady said Kenyan youth require teachers who can help them explore entrepreneurial imagination and creativity. “Our youth need to perform in a diverse and highly competitive world, which is typified by fast advancing technology and innovation,” she said. First Lady urged learning institutions to increase investments in schools to equip children with the necessary skills and knowledge to enable them to compete with their global peers. Noting that instilling a reading culture in students is an integral part of the learning process, the First Lady said the new library, which is named after her, would help inspire that culture, as well as cultivate minds of wonder and curiosity among the students. “I hope it will also motivate our children to be willing to take chances and calculated risks that eventually enable them to chart their own paths to the future,” said the First Lady. She commended Brookhouse for taking a global approach in developing and moulding its students to become global citizens, while at the same time honouring the culture of the host country Kenya.
