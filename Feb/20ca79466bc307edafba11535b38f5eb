Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Elgeyo Marakwet County government has embarked on a campaign to encourage more farmers to venture into cotton growing in a bid to increase its production and enhance diversification. Deputy Governor Wisley Rotich has been tasked to lead the initiative along Kerio Valley where most farmers have abandoned the crop due to collapse of cooperative societies. Rotich asked the farmers to embrace the  crop, saying the county has entered into a deal  with Eldoret-based textile miller, Rivatex, promising them ready market for the produce. “We are moving around the county encouraging farmers to embrace cotton growing now that there is availability of certified seeds, pesticides, training and ready market for the crop,” said Rotich.
