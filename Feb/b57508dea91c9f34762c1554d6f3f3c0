Lynette Matheka @PeopleSport11 Samuel Ndonga stared in the weekend’s Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) Long Course (LC) Nationals gala held from Friday to Sunday as he won three of the four events he took part and finished tied timing in one. The Otters Swim Club youngster registered 25.48 seconds in 50m free style to tie with Bandari’s Nelson Nobby in the final that had brought together 14 swimmers producing two ties. The second tie was between Eddy Ciaran and Adrian Ngweno in sixth place in 27.25. The 21-year-old won in 50,100 and 200m LC breaststroke. Ndonga posted 31.23 in 50m, 1.10.82 in 100m and 2.42.45 in 200m in the gala he says was a gauge for his levels of fitness ahead of the anticipated April National trials. “I have been training for the April trials that will be meant to select national teams to All Africa Games, World Championships and the Olympics. I, however, chose to participate in this competition so as to gauge how good I have gotten since the last competition in October,” said Ndonga. The former Aga Khan School swimmer has also set his sights on two National Records (NR) when the swimmers meet in April for the national trials. “My Personal Best (PB) in 50m LC breaststroke is30.84. I am training for a new national record. Currently the record is held by Micah Fernandez at 30.05.    I also want to lower my 100m LC breaststroke PB is 1.49.45 which is two seconds shy of the national record held by Fernandez too,” the third year Entrepreneurship student said. The elder brother of Sports Personality of the Year (SOYA) winner Emmanuel Ndonga says that making the Olympics team in the April trials will be good for him and younger local swimmers as it will restore hope in the sport for home-based swimmers. “Most of the swimmers representing Kenya in the international competitions are foreign-based. Hitting the qualifying times for an event as prestigious as the Olympics while training at home will go a long way in encouraging the youngsters who are either giving up on the sport or opting to train outside the country,”   Ndonga said. He added, “It requires a lot of sacrifice and commitment to be the best and compete against the best in the world. I might be forced to shelf my studies in preparation for next year’s Olympics if I make the times.” Meanwhile, Hadassah Gichovi won the 100m LC breaststroke in 1.23.04 while Virginia Okumu won the 200m LC freestyle in 2.28.21.
