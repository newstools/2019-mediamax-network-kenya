Tourism stakeholders in western Kenya circuit have been challenged to develop products that will increase the region’s attractiveness. Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said the region lacks national competitiveness due to undeveloped and poorly packaged tourism products. He said that despite its huge potential, the circuit is still performing below the expectations. While assuring on the government’s commitment to market the region’s tourism hub, he said, the stakeholders must collectively do their best in developing and packaging the existing products. “We need to see collaborative efforts by the sector players in shaping-up the region’s domestic tourism hub so that it stands to be competitive among the other best performing tourism circuits in the country,” said Balala. The tourism circuit comprises Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Kericho, Vihiga, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Nandi and Trans Nzoia counties. Addressing a stakeholders’ meeting in Kisumu on Monday, he stressed the need for collaboration between the county governments and private sector in improving the region’s domestic tourism performance. He announced that the ministry’s plan to set up regional tourism councils is on course, a move he said seeks to market tourism products in single entities. He further urged counties within the region to shift focus on promoting culture and beach tourism whose potential remains largely untapped. “We want to move the sector from being a private-investor driven business to government centered investment,” added Balala.
