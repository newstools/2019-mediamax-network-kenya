Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe The health sector is staring at another crisis as clinical  officers have now threatened to join the nurses strike, following stalling of negotiations on their collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO) has accused the Council of Governors (CoG) of not heeding to the demands, agreed upon on October 5, 2017. “The culture of our government is to maintain good laws but cannot implement them,” claimed George Gibore, union secretary general. Clinical officers want call allowances increased from between Sh3,000 and Sh10,000 to Sh30,000 and Sh70,000. The clinical officers will hold a council meeting on February 16 to discuss the next course of action. The officers’ strike threats come when county governments are struggling to address the nurses strike, which started last week. Nurses are demanding for the full implementation of a return-to-work formula, which they agreed on with the government in November, 2017. The nurses want nursing service allowance and uniform allowance, among others. Only Migori, Machakos, Kwale and Nairobi counties have fully honoured the return-to-work formula while Mombasa, which had honoured the agreement, withdrew the payment from the January salary. Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) secretary general Seth Panyako has said the nurses strike will continue and no court order or threats will intimidate them.
