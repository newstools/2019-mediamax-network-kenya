Teresa Ombiti and Susan Jenipher. A section of hawkers in Mombasa Friday defended Governor Hassan Joho against claims of engagement in illicit drugs trade. This comes after some Jubilee Party-allied leaders, led by Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, claimed this week that Joho is wanted by Interpol over links to drug trade. The hawkers, under the umbrella of Association of Medium and Small Enterprises Associations of Kenya (Amsea), said the claims were meant to tarnish Joho’s name so as to stop his presidential bid. They asked Joho to ignore those trying to tarnish his name and concentrate on serving Mombasa residents. Amsea Mombasa chairman Hamisi Dawa said traders are happy and contented with Joho’s leadership. “We are asking Sang to deal with issues of cattle rustling in his county and leave Joho alone since we are happy with his work,” he said. Amsea coordinator Simon Kiarie said the drugs claims are unfounded and asked those with proof to take it to the police. Asked why they were defending Joho, Kiarie said the governor’s administration has done much to support small-scale businesses by building more stalls and ending harassment by county askaris. “We are warning Sang, MPs Kimani Ichung’wa ( Kikuyu), Oscar Sudi (Kapsaret) and Dismus Barasa (Kimilili) to leave Joho alone and concentrate on the development of their counties,” said Kiarie. Ali Mohammed, an Amsea member, asked the leaders to substantiate their claims by providing evidence that Joho has any links to drug trade. Some MPs from ODM party and Mombasa have also defended Joho against the drugs claims.
