Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin Delayed construction and development works at two airports and four airstrips is part of the Sh79.1 billion stalled infrastructure projects, Treasury has indicated. This comes in the wake of a freeze on new projects by President Uhuru Kenyatta as the government mulls over payments made to delayed, abandoned and stalled projects totaling 545 with a value of  Sh365.9 billion. A document dubbed ‘Stalled Capital projects’ tabled in Parliament last week by Leader of Majority Aden Duale reveals suspension and stalling of key airport and airstrip development worth Sh2.2 billion, a move that is undermining efforts to expand and improve the aviation industry. Despite the government having spent Sh550.4 million on initiating the projects, none is complete with some dating back to 2014. Top on the list is the rehabilitation of the Wajir Airport (apron, runway, taxiways, security road and access road) at an estimated cost of Sh819.3 million. The project, which was being fully funded by the government, commenced on August 5, 2017. It was suspended while at 15 per cent complete, even as contactors pocketed Sh127.1 million. “Kenya Defence Forces recalled this project for re-scoping of the works, the exercise is complete and the Defence Principal secretary has been notified of the same to advice on the way forward,” Treasury notes in its report. The development of the Wagadud Airstrip at a cost of Sh609.2 million stands suspended. Designs for the project are, however, complete. Treasury last week reported that security assessment is being done to implement the project which is yet to commence despite being commissioned in May 2016. Another stalled development is civil works at the Nanyuki Airstrip where the contract was terminated in August 2016, despite the government paying out Sh142.7 million in the Sh399 million project. “Out of court negotiations between the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA)and the contractor ongoing,” Treasury updated the State in the document addressed to the clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai. Works at the Sh240 million Voi Ikanga Airstrip also remain suspended. The project was started on May 1, 2015 with a completion schedule of May 5, 2016. The project was 90 per cent complete by the time of its suspension with the government spending Sh227.5 million. “The project has boundary dispute with locals. The arbitral process with the contractor due to delays in works execution is ongoing,” said Treasury. Land for expansion The Tseikuru Airstrip, a development worth Sh76 million has stalled because of costs emanating from the contractor (National Youth Service) who is demanding an extra Sh25 million to finalise the works. “The next phase of works will be undertaken once land for expansion is acquired from Kitui county government. The report is shortly being shared with the National Land Commission for advice on appropriateness of the process carried out so far,” said Treasury. Though the government has spent Sh50 million on the project, implementation remains unquantified. The sixth project is construction of washrooms and security offices at the Wilson Airport at a cost of Sh8.9 million. The project, which was 40 per cent complete, was suspended due to change of business plan at the site. The designs for an administration building within the site (which will incorporate the stalled building) are, however, complete. The building will be executed once a budget is available and will accommodate all airport staff including other government agencies, Treasury has noted.
