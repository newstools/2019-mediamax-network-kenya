Mathew Ndung’u, Clement Kamau and Oliver Musembi @PeopleDailyKe Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has issued more than Sh100 million to over 5,000 recovering  addicts as a sendoff package bringing the one year ‘Kaa Sober’ programme to a climax. At least 5,120 youth graduated on Tuesday with three months short technical courses offered in the county polytechnics. The programme has since inception cost the county over Sh3.6 billion. “The initiative has been costly as the county has been spending Sh2 million in a day,” said Waititu while handing certificates of completion at Ndumberi grounds in Kiambu town. After assuming office, Waititu, in a bid to help the youths addicted to alcohol, started a county alcoholic addicts rehabilitation programme called ‘Kaa Sober’ on February 4, last year which has been engaging youths in casual labour in return for daily wages. The programme started by recruiting 100 youths and illicit brew dealers from Makwa and Gatukuyu villages in Gatundu North. Encouraged by the impact of the programme in the 60 wards, Waititu says he will roll out Jijenge funds in two weeks, an initiative that will see the recovered addicts access cheap loans to start income-generating projects. Although beneficiaries of the programme say they are fully recovered, some ferried in buses were seen drinking begging the question  whether the programme achieved its intended purpose. But Waititu maintains the plan has achieved its purpose. “The programme has transformed lives. Many unmarried men and women are now married after the initiative. We will not stop at this…the graduands will enjoy Jijenge fund loans,” he said. Kiambu leaders have been critical of the programme, saying the programme is unsustainable and that Waititu did not consult them. However, the governor told them off saying: “This is my project. Other leaders can initiate their own,  I owe no one answers on the running of Kaa Sober,” he said.
