Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma has assured that Kenya’s bid to secure a non-permanent membership slot at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is on course. Kenya offered herself for the position last year, with Juma, saying the move is informed by the critical role it continues to play in contributing to global peace and security. And yesterday, the CS reached out to visiting Swedish Foreign Affairs minister, Margot Wallström to support Kenya’s bid for the 2021-2022 period. Kenya will be seeking the position during the 74th  sessions of the UNSC Assembly, scheduled for September. “We offered ourselves for the non-permanent membership slot of the UNSC. It is our hope that Sweden will help us to campaign in regard to the UNSC membership for the 2021-22 term and we have no doubt that our aspirations to contribute to peace and security stands strong,” she said.
