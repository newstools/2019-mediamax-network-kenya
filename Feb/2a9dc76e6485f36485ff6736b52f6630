Kenya’s Angela Okutoyi fought back to defeat French player Tiantsoa Sarah Rakotamanaga 6-3, 7-6(4) and earn a place in the ITF Juniors semi-finals yesterday. Okutoyi had displayed solid play in the opening set as she constantly prodded her opponent who made costly errors on return serves in the quarter-final match at Nairobi Club. The Kenyan took the first four games straight before Rakotamanaga broke her twice as she attempted to catch up. In the second set, the unseeded French player came alive as she ran Okutoyi rugged with deep and fast play. She took a commanding 5-1 following a series of mistakes by her opponent. The Kenyan was struggling for comfort and Rakotamanaga was in no mood to go easy. However, the patient Okutoyi pulled herself together to win three games straight thus rattling her opponent who seemed off the pace even with a third set almost certain. Her poor ball placements and erratic first serve meant Okutoyi closed in well, forcing a tie-break which the Kenyan duly converted on advantage points difference. “It was working well for me on the first set but I relaxed in the second. The difference was mental strength. However, I must work on my ability to close out matches and avoid being too casual in my play ahead of the semi-final,” said Okutoyi. In the boys’ match, Kenyan Albert Njogu saw off familiar foe Aly Shokeir of Egypt 7-5, 6-4 in a tight contest while Derick Ominde lost in straight sets of 6-2, 6-2 to Burundian top seed Abdoul Shakur Kabura. Ominde, who had easily downed Canadian Ghouse Faisal 6-2, 6-1 in the third round on Wednesday was, however, no match for his opponent.
