Tell us about yourself I am Juliet Ajhiambo and I’m 14 years old. I go to Muthurwa Primary School, where I’m in the 4-H club. I joined last year after becoming interested in it, as I would see the club members farming during their free time, so I decided to try it out. What is the 4-H club all about and how has it helped you in learning about farming? Through our patron Norah Beldinah, 4-H has taught us about good agriculture routines. We learn everything from picking the best seeds to how to plant and how we can make money from selling what we get from our farm. What do you plant in your farm? We grow kale, onions and sweet potatoes. What other activities is the club involved in apart from farming? I also love shoemaking, beadwork, weaving and I play in my school’s  football team. How do you balance farming and schoolwork? I go to the farm during break times, to ensure that I attend my classes and do my homework. Who is your role model? Amina Mohammed, the Education CS. She inspires me to be a successful woman. What’s your favourite subject? English. I enjoy learning the language.
