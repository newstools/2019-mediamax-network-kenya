Lands Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung’aro yesterday warned people who hang around the ministry offices with the intention of exploiting clients that they will be arrested. He said the ministry is aware that fraudsters, who operate under the guise of assisting people seeking services in Lands offices, have been exploiting Kenyans. Speaking at Lands offices in Kericho town when he made an impromptu visit, Mung’aro said the ministry would not allow conmen or cartels to reap where they had not sowed. “We will ensure no cartels hang around the offices because they exploit the ignorance of the members of the public. Some even impersonate ministry officials,” said Mung’aro. He said the ministry had launched the Wizara Mashinani programme where officers from the ministry headquarters make surprise visits to Lands offices across the country to find out challenges facing clients. The CAS assured residents that plans to expand Kericho town were on course.
