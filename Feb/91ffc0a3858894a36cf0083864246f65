Lynette Matheka @PeopleSports11 Upper Hill School have chosen to defend their rugby 15s title in this year’s competitions following changes introduced by the Ministry of Education to the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association’s (KSSSA) calendar where 7s and 15s will run in Term One. The Nairobi-based side will start their title defence campaign at the sub-county level and coach Thomas Walgwe is confident they will have an easy time at that stage. Walgwe took over the team in the 2018 competitions, taking over from his brother Victor Walgwe who had moved to Dagoretti High, and guided them to their maiden East Africa and national school games rugby 15s titles. “We are going for another double. We know it will be a lot of work as other teams will be out to dethrone us but we are preparing with that in mind,” the coach said. The tactician will do without the services of seven players from last year’s squad as they have since finished school. However, Walgwe says he is not moved but that as he has able replacements. “Not having the seven is no cause for worry because, as opposed to depending on individual players, we put our faith in the systems and programmes we have put in place to mould all our players. Their exit is an opportunity for other players in the second team to be promoted to the main team and prove their mettle,” said Walgwe adding that training is underway and he is impressed by his players’ performance. Last year, Upper Hill beat Menengai in sudden death at the nationals to clinch their maiden title unbeaten, having finished third in the 2017 competitions. At the regional level, Walgwe’s charges clinched the title on the sixth day of the games after thrashing Uganda’s St Mary’s Kisubi 35-12 in their fourth and final match to finish on 16 points.
