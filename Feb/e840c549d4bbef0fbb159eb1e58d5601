Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Striking nurses who fail to report to work today face the sack after governors and the National government yesterday pledged to implement President Uhuru Kenyatta’s order. Through their chair Wycliffe Oparanya, the Council of Governors ordered  a roll call taken today at 8am. “The National and County governments stand with the President’s pronouncement. A roll call will be undertaken by both levels of government at 8am, any nurse who will fail to return to work will be dismissed,” he said. Oparanya termed the strike  unlawful following a court ruling on February 6 which suspended the strike for 60 days ordering all parties to attend conciliatory talks which were initiated by Labour Cabinet secretary Ukur Yattani. He dismissed Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) secretary general Seth Panyako  claims the union has not been served with the court order, saying the union was served with the order on February 6. Elsewhere, Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki  warned that nurses face contempt of court charges if they do not resume work by 8am today. Kariuki  said the National government and Council of Governors have agreed to file the charges because the  strike by the nurses union members is illegal. Speaking in Meru county where she launched the National Breaking Transmission Strategy 2019-2023 to address neglected tropical and surgical diseases,  Kariuki said the nurses have ignored a court order that gave parties 60 days for conciliation. “The courts have spoken and the nurses have gone against the order. Union officials have already been served with the court orders. This is not a threat but all nurses are expected at work tomorrow as the President and the governors directed,”  Kariuki said.
