Hillary Mageka and Antony Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe A storm is brewing in the Opposition coalition after Amani National Congress (ANC) accused the dominant Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) of political intolerance and bullying in sharing of House leadership slots. ANC MPs returned to the bicameral Parliament after the long recess to a shocking revelation that their members had been elbowed out from House Business Committees in the National Assembly and Senate. In the National Assembly, Emuhaya MP Omboko  Milemba (ANC) was replaced by his nominated colleague Godfrey Osotsi while in Senate, nominated Senator  Petronillah Were was replaced by her nominated ODM counterpart Beatrice Kwamboka. Some ANC members protested the changes in the committees, citing breach of the coalition agreement. Lugari MP Ayub Savula accused ODM, led by Raila Odinga, of using intimidation to settle scores in National Super Alliance (Nasa) members. “We need to be consulted as a party as we still belong to Nasa and no one has written a letter to registrar of political parties to deny its existence,” Savula (pictured) told the press at Parliament building. At the end of last session, ANC had complained over the substitution  of its members in various House committees after Butere MP Tindi Mwale, who is also ANC Chief Whip was  de-whipped from Public Investment Committee and replaced by Homa Bay Women representative Gladys Wanga (ODM). In the Senate, Nasa re-submitted the names of Senators  Cleophas Malalah (Kakamega) and Ledama ole Kina (Narok), while Jubilee Party replaced West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghiso and his Nairobi counterpart Johnson Sakaja with Githiomi Mwangi (Nyandarua), Mohamed Mahamud (Mandera) and Andrew Langat (Bomet). However, the ruling party retained Deputy Leader of Majority, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo. In the National Assembly, ODM and Wiper retained Mishi Mboko (Likoni) and Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) in the committee.
