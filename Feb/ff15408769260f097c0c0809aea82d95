Amos Abuga @Peoplesports11 Captain Florence Wasike was the star attraction as Team Kenya returned to a low key reception after winning 41 medals for a second place finish at the Africa Masters Athletics Championships in Tunis, Tunisia last weekend. Wasike led from the front as Kenya managed 31 gold, nine silver and one bronze, only bettered by hosts Tunisia, who collected 60 medals 48 gold, nine silver and three bronze. The runner, who has represented the country in three Commonwealth Games, is impressed by the performance exhibited by the entire team. “The atmosphere in Tunisia was really good. Every athlete performed so well in their category and I am honoured to have captained the team,” the mother of one told People Sport. Of the 31 gold medals the country won, Wasike contributed four, having excelled in the 100m and 400m hurdles, 4x100m relays and 4x400m relays. “I was in Spain last year for the World Masters and the performance was not that good since it was my first appearance at the masters. With the experience I gained, I know it can only get better,” added the five-time national hurdles champion. Among the other top performers in the team was 2014 Delhi Commonwealth 4x400m silver medallist Vincent Mumo who recorded a double in 200m and 400m. The returning team was without Stephen Kamande (M65) who won both 10km Road Race and Half Marathon respectively. With temperatures as high as 41 degrees, the runner could not cope and thus stayed behind with coach Sammy Ruto and will travel today.
