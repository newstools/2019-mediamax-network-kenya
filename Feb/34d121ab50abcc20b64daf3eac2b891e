Greenfield Terminal is the biggest among abandoned airport infrastructure projects, Treasury has revealed, as seven key airport and airstrips works fall behind schedule. Stationed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the Sh64.7 billion project was abandoned on March 9, 2016 after Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) terminated the contract which had been awarded to Anhui Construction Engineering Group Ltd in 2013, in a joint venture with China Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation. It had been designed to encompass 50 international and 10 domestic checkpoints, 32 contact and eight remote gates. KAA cited “prevailing operational, economic and financial dynamics” as the reason for abandonment of the new terminal which had been designed to handle 8.7 million passengers annually on 178,000 square metres. “The decision was based on prevailing operational, economic and financial dynamics which have been on a downward trend over the last three years,” said KAA in a statement in March 2016. Its termination ended Kenya’s dream of having the largest terminal in Africa, even as the then KAA acting managing director Yatich Kangugo argued reorganisation and modernisation of JKIA had expanded capacity at the new Terminal 2 by 2.5 million passengers. In a ‘stalled capital projects’ update by Treasury, tabled in the Parliament last week, its contractor pocketed Sh4.3 billion as of June 2018, despite not having undertaken any work. Greenfield, which was to be fully funded by the government with a completion date of December 4, 2016, was five per cent complete by the time of its abandonment, Treasury documents show. Site clearing and equipment mobilisation was underway when the contract was terminated. Vision 2030 President Uhuru Kenyatta launched it on November 13, 2013, after its conception under the Grand Coalition Government as part of flagship Vision 2030 projects. The controversial project had then been approved by the KAA board, the Cabinet, Parliament, public procurement authorities and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Its implementation would have seen Kenya become home to the largest terminal. The closest airport terminal, in terms of capacity, would have been South Africa’s OR  Tambo’s central terminal with a capacity of 12 million passengers. In June last year, KAA management, for a second time, was grilled for failing to table supporting documents on the payment to the Chinese contactor in the abandoned project. The Public Investments Committee (PIC) accused KAA management of conspiring to conceal documentation needed to justify an audit query on the tender which had been raised by Auditor-General Edward Ouko. When he appeared before PIC, KAA chief executive Jonny Andersen said officers at the authority were still working on information on the Greenfields terminal. “The Greenfields terminal is a very complex matter. The information is yet to be certified by the auditor,” Andersen told the committee chaired by Mvita Member of Parliament Abdulswamad Nassir. KAA was also questioned over Sh413.5 million it paid consultants and law firms, and monies spent on ground-breaking for the terminal. The Auditor General recently said a review of the project revealed that as at June 30, 2017, the contractor had been paid Sh4.3 billion while Sh216.1 million had been extended to consultancy, with no evidence of work done. Airstrip projects A further Sh75 million was spent on ground-breaking ceremony of the project which was to be implemented on design-and-build model. The Transport ministry has 10 stalled projects worth Sh79 billion, the Treasury documents indicate, where others include reallocation unit at Kibera and Mukuru(Sh12.03 billion), Embakasi land fencing works(Sh31.7 million), development of a transport data centre at Sh130 million and a number of airstrip projects across the country. The transport docket is among the most affected, the document tabled last week by Leader of Majority Aden Duale shows. Treasury’s update comes after it issued a circular on November 15, last year asking all ministries and departments to provide details of stalled capital projects for submission to parliament.s Mercury, because.
