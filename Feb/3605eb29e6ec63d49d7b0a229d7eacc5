Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Broke State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and unattractive tax incentives are the biggest threats to the realisation of the government’s Big Four agenda, a survey by Kenya Business Guide (KBS) indicates. KBS project lead Shahi Shah said the SOEs, which gobble about five to six per cent of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), need to be restructured to ease the pressure to Treasury and the funds diverted towards the realisation of Big Four agenda projects. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy during a period of time. He said despite pumping that amount to SOEs, the results in terms of the dividend was, however, negligible. “The funds budgeted for the SOEs in Kenya have increased from Sh169 billion in 2014 to Sh414.3 billion in 2017 – funds which could be used for any of the Big Four,” said Shah. He said there is need for the government to restructure some of the SOEs to ease the pressure on the government and the money and the funds budgeted for them be channelled elsewhere. “The 2013 Presidential Taskforce on Parastatal Reforms suggested the reduction of SOEs from 262 to 187 in a bid to reduce the pressure on Treasury,” he said. He said the situation gets worse when the entities – which are supposed to remit dividends to the government remit nothing to Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) rather than creating employment. “Usually, what the Government gets in return is usually very small,” he said. Shah said there is need to evaluate the mission and goals of SOEs.
