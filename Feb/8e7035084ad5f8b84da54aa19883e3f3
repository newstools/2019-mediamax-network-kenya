Steve Umidha @steveumidha After months of steep descent, retail fuel prices in the country are highly expected to continue heading south with hopes high as Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) releases this month’s price review today. Petrol and diesel prices have dropped significantly for the last two months on the back of softening global crude prices. And now that momentum is expected to carry on for the third-straight month. Prices of petroleum products dropped considerably in the first month of the year, with the sliding fuel prices seen to have lifted the country’s economy and consumption despite being the toughest period of the year for many households. Stable shilling The substantial decline in fuel prices witnessed in mid-December last year, came despite the introduction of eight per cent Value Added Tax (VAT). It is widely anticipated that the trend will sustain in the coming weeks, perhaps months owing to the now stable shilling against major world currencies, which has strengthened in the last few days. Fuel prices rose sharply in the last quarter of 2018 even before the eight per cent VAT law on petroleum products was triggered – a worrying trend that had sparked fears among many households still finding it hard to put decent meals on the table with prices of basic commodities at the time at all-time high. Price of Super petrol in October last year for instance, jumped by Sh3.37 a litre while that of diesel also went up by Sh1.85 as well as kerosene which also increased by Sh1.82. The cost of petrol in the September review, however, reduced by Sh2.21 compared to diesel and kerosene prices which rose marginally by Sh0.39 and Sh0.29 respectively during that period. Petroleum prices Last month, motorists paid Sh9.33 less for super petrol, Sh10.04 less for diesel and Sh3.52 less for kerosene after a review by ERC. The regulator could chose to slightly tweak last month’s figures judging by recent adjustments in the petroleum prices. Motorists in Nairobi paid Sh104.21 for a litre of petrol, down Sh9.33 from Sh113.54 they had been paying since December 14, with the cost of a litre of diesel at the time retailing at Sh102.24. Kerosene sold at Sh101.70 in the city during the period. Consumers in Mombasa paid Sh101.60 for super petrol and Sh99.63 and Sh 99.09 for diesel and kerosene respectively while the commodity in Kisumu sold at Sh105.73 for super petrol and Sh103.94 and Sh103.40 for diesel and kerosene respectively.
