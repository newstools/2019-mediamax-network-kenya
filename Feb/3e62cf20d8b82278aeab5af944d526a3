Barry Silah @obel_barry The newly inaugurated National Youth Service Council has six months to restore order to the organisation. This was revealed during a press briefing yesterday at NYS headquarters where Lt-Gen (Rtd) Njuki Mwaniki was unveiled as the council’s chairman alongside his team in a ceremony presided over by Cabinet secretary for Youth and Gender Affairs Margaret Kobia. In his address, Mwaniki called for teamwork, warning that the task ahead was enormous. He called on the council to find a unifying factor to deliver on their goals as established under the NYS Act. This is coming against the backdrop of a restructuring process of NYS that started mid 2018 with the main objective being enhancing governance. Kobia called on the Council to reverse the organisation’s battered image saying officers should go through an  induction to understand their roles in ensuring NYS reverts to its glory days.
