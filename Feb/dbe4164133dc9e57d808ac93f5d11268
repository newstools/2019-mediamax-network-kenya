A policeman and his son were yesterday arrested over the murder of lawyer Robert Chesang in Lukenya area, Machakos county. The officer attached to Mutuini Police Station in Dagoretti was arrested after it emerged the car used to ferry the killers to Chesang’s house belongs to him. Detectives from Athi River Police Station visited the  station and confiscated eight AK-47 rifles for ballistic tests as part of the probe into the murder. “We want to establish if any of the weapons was used in the murder. They are prime suspects for now,” said an officer aware of the probe. More suspects linked to the murder were being sought  yesterday. Chesang was killed by gunmen who raided his house at Moke Gardens in broad daylight on February 17. A postmortem showed he died out of profuse bleeding. He was shot at seven times. Police who arrived the scene of the crime said they recovered seven spent cartridges of an AK-47 rifle.
