Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Uasin Gishu elected leaders have urged the government to decentralise issuance of birth and death certificates to sub-county levels to end the long queues witnessed at the county civil registration office. Speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of National Government Constituency Development Fund office in Turbo constituency, they decried bribery among some civil registration officials. Led by Governor Jackson Mandago, the leaders claimed the officials were taking advantage of the long queue at the county registration office to extort money from desperate parents and guardians seeking the documents for their children. Mandago who was accompanied by his deputy Daniel Chemno, Turbo MP Janet Sitienei and her Soy counterpart Caleb Kositany, asked Interior Cabinet secretary  Fred Matiang’i to make an impromptu visit of the county civil registration office to assess the situation.
