Joseph Kori Karue, husband of Mary Wambui Kamangara, who was allegedly killed by his secret lover has been released from police custody for lack of evidence. He, however, is now due to become a state witness, according to police sources. Kori had been detained alongside prime suspect Judy Wangui Mungai and taxi driver Michael Githae Mathenge pending completion of investigations. However, homicide detectives have delinked Kori from active participation in the murder of his wife although he remains a person of interest to the detectives. Kori was picked by homicide detectives from Gigiri Police Station on Thursday night before being set free.  “He was released yesterday night, ” a police source intimated. Police investigations done through reviews of CCTV footage and confessions by Mathenge have placed Wangui and Mathenge as an accomplice who aided the  disposal of the body in Thika.  At the time, Kori  was in Ngong and not at the scene of the  murder as Wangui had claimed. Detectives from Juja Police Station had exonerated  Kori from his wife’s murder, saying from their investigations, there is no way that the businessman could have been involved. The detectives said Kori’s cell phone data and details of a car tracking device in his Toyota Lexus indicated that on December 26, 2018, the day Wambui was lured to her death trap at Ms Wangui’s residence, he was in Ngong, Kajiado. He left Ngong at 9pm, the investigations showed. Meanwhile, police are holding a man who reportedly battered his wife to death in Kahawa Sukari Nairobi. Laiko Osuri is being held at Kahawa Sukari Police Station over the death of his 28-year-old fiancée Beryl Adhiambo.
