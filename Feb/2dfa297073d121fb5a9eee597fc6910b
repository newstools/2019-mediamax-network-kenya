Madrid, Tuesday @PeopleSport11 After scoring three goals in his last eight appearances for Real Madrid, Croatia captain Luka Modric looks to be getting back to his best. Luka Modric is back in form and the Real Madrid midfielder will have a key part to play when his side face off against Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. A last-four tie that pits Spain’s biggest two clubs together is a mouth-watering prospect, with the recent resurgence of both Modric and Madrid threatening Barca’s recent dominance of the cup. Barca are hunting a fifth consecutive Copa del Rey crown and with Madrid well off the pace in LaLiga, they are eight points behind the league leaders, this could be their best chance of adding to the silverware they won at last year’s Club World Cup. Santiago Solari has finally found a winning formula at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Madrid victorious in five games in a row in all competitions ahead of Wednesday’s first-leg trip to Camp Nou. Central to their success has been Modric, who is hitting top form again after a slow start to the season that was disrupted by speculation he could leave for Serie A giants Inter, as well as understandable fatigue from his efforts in leading Croatia to the World Cup final. Modric was rightly garlanded as the player of the tournament at the end of Russia 2018 but when he collected a maiden Ballon d’Or in December’s glitzy ceremony, it felt slightly jarring. The 33-year-old had been struggling under Julen Lopetegui with his below-par performances contributing to the bad results that led to the sacking of the former Spain coach.  -FOTMOB
