Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe At least 10 staff quarters and a welfare canteen were razed  by an inferno at Nairobi West Prison over the weekend. Although the cause of the fire is yet to be established, preliminary findings showed it was sparked by a leaking cooking  gas cylinder. No casualties were reported during the Saturday night incident. “We have lost property. The affected families have been accommodated by colleagues,” one of the prison Warden said. The fire reportedly originated from the welfare canteen within the compound before spreading to adjacent houses. Efforts to reach Prisons Commissioner General Isaiah Osugu over the matter were futile.
