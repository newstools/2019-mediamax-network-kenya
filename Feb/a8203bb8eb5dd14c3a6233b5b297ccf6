Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) Nairobi Chapter (Kncci) chairman Richard Ngatia is poised to succeed Kiprono Kittony as the chamber boss as the latter’s term comes to an end. The chamber has proposed a raft of changes including renaming the national chairman’s position to be referred to as the chamber president and vice-president. So far, Ngatia, James Mureu (National Vice Chairman), Stephen Mbugua (chairman, Membership and Business Development Committee) and Laban Rao Onditi have expressed interest for the chamber’s president. “The chamber has also introduced a position of second vice president who shall be an appointee of the president and meant to address skills, gender, regional, youth and disability related imbalance at the top leadership of the chamber.” A draft report presented to 450 delegates during the chamber’s annual general meeting held at the Nairobi Hospital Convention Centre reads in part. The delegates endorsed Ngatia for the president’s post and seemingly the frontrunner in the race to succeed Kittony.
