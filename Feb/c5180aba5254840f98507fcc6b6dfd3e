Manchester, Sunday @PeopleSports11 Sergio Aguero equalled the record for Premier League hat-tricks as a rampant Manchester City thrashed Chelsea 6-0 at home to leapfrog Liverpool and return to the table’s summit. Chelsea were hammered 4-0 at Bournemouth in their last away league match and Maurizio Sarri’s side were taken apart by the defending champions at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the Blues suffering their heaviest ever Premier League loss. Son Heung-min burst clear to score Tottenham’s third in the final seconds and create the illusion this might have been another routine home win. It was, in fact, anything but. Davinson Sanchez headed Spurs into the lead in the first half but Leicester missed a glut of wonderful chances, including a penalty which proved the key moment in the game. The taking of the spot-kick was delayed in order to allow Jamie Vardy on to take it but Hugo Lloris saved and three minutes later, Christian Eriksen extended the lead. Vardy then pulled one back and Leicester were pushing for an equaliser when Son was released to sprint clear and fire past Kaspser Schmeichel. Leicester despaired and Tottenham added another three points to their collection as they clung to the fringes of the title race.  –AGENCIES
