Brussels, Tuesday The European Union wants to hear what Theresa May plans to do on Brexit, a spokesman for the bloc said ahead of the British prime minister talks  with EU in Brussels on Thursday. “The European Union’s position is clear,” the spokesman for the EU’s executive Commission, Margaritis Schinas, told a news conference. “We are expecting, waiting once again to hear what the prime minister has to tell us.” May is due to meet European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday after her parliament told her to go back to Brussels and demand changes to the Brexit divorce deal she had negotiated with the bloc. Border backstop The move comes as Northern Irish party which props up May’s minority government demanded on Tuesday that the European Union replace the “toxic” Irish border backstop she agreed, so that the United Kingdom can quit the bloc in an orderly fashion. With the United Kingdom due to leave the EU in just 52 days, London and Brussels are arguing over whether the deal clinched in November can be changed, raising the possibility of a delay to Brexit, a last-minute deal or a no-deal exit. Since British members of parliament voted down the withdrawal agreement last month, parliament has instructed May to replace its most contentious element — an insurance policy covering the possible future arrangements for the border in Ireland. Britain, Ireland and the EU want to avoid physical checks on the border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland that ceased with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. There is little appetite for a no-deal Brexit in the EU and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the bloc’s most powerful leader, has called for creativity to break the Brexit impasse. “From a political point of view, there is still time,” Merkel told an economic conference in Tokyo on Tuesday.                                            – Agency
