Hanoi, Wednesday US President Donald Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the start of their second summit Wednesday, saying the totalitarian state could enjoy a brilliant future if it gives up nuclear weapons. Trump predicted a “very successful” summit as the pair prepared for dinner at the luxury Sofitel Legend Metropole hotel in Hanoi to follow up on their initial meeting in Singapore in June. In a brief sit-down ahead of talks, Trump repeated his view that North Korea had “tremendous” economic potential. For his part, Kim pledged to do his “best” to achieve an outcome that “will be welcomed by all people.” They were due to open with about 20 minutes of talks before sitting around a table with a handful of top advisers. Earlier, Trump sent a tweet touting North Korea’s “AWESOME” potential if his “friend” Kim agrees to relinquish his weapons. The president risks being distracted by scandal back in Washington, where his former lawyer Michael Cohen was set to describe him as a “conman” in bombshell testimony to Congress scheduled for shortly after the summit dinner ends on the other side of the world. — AFP
