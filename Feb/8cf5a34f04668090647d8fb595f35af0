Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary general Wilson Sossion wants Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to come up with a policy before hiring intern teachers. The Knut boss said the union will not accept hiring of teachers in contracts without proper policies saying TSC must come up with proper guidlines before hiring the 68,000 interns it announced recently. Sail smoothly “There must be a clear policy before interns are hired. We need to know when they will be employed on permanent and pensionable terms. We are serious in this and TSC should move in this direction so that the issue sails smoothly,” said Sossion in Litein. He urged his fellow legislators  to push  and ensure there is a policy  with a view to paving the way for hiring of the intern teachers by TSC.
