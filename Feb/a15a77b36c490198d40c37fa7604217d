Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Government officials, who approved construction of buildings on riparian or irregularly acquired land, are being investigated by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Senate Lands and Environment committee heard yesterday. Appearing before the committee, Environment Cabinet secretary Keriako Tobiko (pictured) said the arrests and prosecution will be extend to State officials, who approved licences, permits and title deeds for properties erected on road reserves and other public utility land. “The DCI and DPP are handling the matter. Officials who have been implicated in this have recorded statements. Receiving approvals to set up a structure does not render the process of acquiring it legal,” said Tobiko. The revelations follow a petition by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, who inquired what legal action is being taken against officials in various government agencies, who gave fraudulent approvals to the illegal structures that have since been demolished. Tobiko was hard pressed to explain why evictions and destruction of property by the Nairobi Regeneration team to reclaim public land, road reserves and riparian land was done in a “nearly inhumane manner”. “We support reclamation but  some human rights issues have been abused. What is our role as government? ” asked  nominated Senator Abshiro Halake.
