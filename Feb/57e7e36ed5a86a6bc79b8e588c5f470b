Ericson Kiprono @PeopleSports11 Former world record holder Wilson Kipsang and 2017 London Marathon champion Daniel Wanjuru have laid down elaborate plans that will see them conquer what will be the most hotly-contested London Marathon in recent history. With the rivalry between 2018 winner and world record holder Eliud Kipchoge and homeboy Mo Farah dominating the headlines once the entry list was announced, Kipsang and Wanjiru barely got a mention but they have vowed to upset the form book. Kipsang, a two-time London Marathon winner (2012 and 2014) has not been lucky on his recent visits to the English capital, finishing a disappointing fifth in 2016 after collecting silver in 2015 and after a two-year hiatus, he wants to make amends in 2019. As part of his preparations, Kipsang will compete at the Vitality Big Half Marathon in London on March 10 ahead of the big one in the same city on April 28. “I will start with the Vitality Big half marathon in March to gauge my preparedness and see where I need to improve in training,” said Kipsang who set a marathon world record of 2:03:23 in 2013 in Berlin before it was toppled by compatriots Dennis Kimetto in 2014 and Eliud Kipchoge last year at the same venue. For Wanjuru, it is about proving that he has not lost his mojo since he burst onto the scene in 2015 when he won the Prague Marathon which he defended in 2016 before adding an Amsterdam Marathon crown the same year. He would surprise all by claiming the London marathon title in 2017 before injuries struck. “I have resumed training because I want to go to London and prove my critics wrong. Since my win in 2017, I have had it rough with injuries and poor form. It has lasted for almost two years but I want that to change and start winning in 2019,” said Wanjiru. Like Kipsang, Wanjuru will also be in London to gauge his level of preparedness at the Vitality race which he lost to Farah in last year’s edition. “In 2018, I was never lucky enough to get to the podium in any marathon but that will change because I know I have the talent,” added Wanjiru.
