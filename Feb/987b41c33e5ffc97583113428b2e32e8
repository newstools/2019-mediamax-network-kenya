George Kebaso @Morarak Former Vice-President Kalonzo Musyoka is firmly in the race for president in the 2022 elections, his Wiper Democratic Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) said yesterday. Contrary to reports that he would support the extension of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s term, party officials led by vice chair Chirau Ali Mwakwere said Kalonzo’s name will be on the ballot in the next election. “The party, having met today at Wiper House in Karen, resolved that we appreciate the large turnout at KOMA II Convention and fully associate ourselves with its resolutions,” the leaders said in a statement read by Mwakwere. He was referring to February 8 meeting at Kiamba Primary School in Matungulu, Machakos, which unanimously endorsed Kalonzo as the party’s flag bearer in the 2022 General Election. Party members also resolved to support Kalonzo’s call for an expanded Executive. Kalonzo has been criticised for allegedly calling for extension of  Uhuru’s tenure when it ends in 2022. In recent weeks, the Wiper leader has been under siege from governors Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui) who have been asking him to retire from active politics. But Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has endorsed Kalonzo’s presidential ambitions.
