Barry SilahÂ @obel_barry Ushuru have once again lost ground in the National Super League (NSL) chase following their 1-1 draw against visiting Coast Stima yesterday at Ruaraka Grounds. Edwin Mwaura opened the scoring in the 15th minute following a ball-handling situation at the Coast Stima box. He stepped up to convert even with the opposing players and the technical bench opposing the decision by centre referee Edward Karia. Apart from that, there was precious little to pick from the two sides in the first half. In the second half, the game opened up with Ushuru keen to add another goal. The attack pair of Jeremiah Wanjala and Barack Odhiambo prodded spaces but the defensive partnership of Razick Owuor and Alfred Maningi was rock solid covering custodian Godfrey Lowo in disciplined fashion. A quick counter attack from the backline of Coast Stima in the 51st minute caught the midfield of Ushuru unawares and the final delivery by Omar Sharrif was well collected by Collins Kambo who turned in the opposing defenders and slide home past the equaliser. Earlier in the 60th and 67th minute, Mwaura and Wanjala were left gutted after their good moves were thwarted while in the 60th minute of play, Abbas Muhiddin who had been set up by the tireless skipper Joshua Oyoo fluffed his shot with the goal to his mercy. The taxmen have yet to pick full points inside four matches and the frustration on coach Ken Kenyatta was clearly telling even as leaders Wazito bid to open the two-point gap at the top with a trip to Thika United today. Meanwhile Nairobi Stima and FC Talanta piled pressure on the front two after important wins that put them on 31 points. Stima beat Migori Youth 1-0 at Karuturi Grounds while FC Talanta beat Kangemi Allstars 2-0 at Camp Toyoyo.
