Shabana chairman Jared Nivaton has defended the club’s decision to suspend secretary general Paul Mayieko, saying that the decision was reached after it was found that the latter is behind the team’s recent poor performance. Nivaton sensationally blamed Mayieko for alleged sabotage. He claimed the secretary is working with cartels that are slowly finding their way into the club and forming roots to wobble the team leading to their recent shocking losing streak. After a strong start to the season with five run of matches unbeaten, Shabana dipped and literally are in the pits following their sixth loss of the campaign and Nivaton has lifted the lid on the rot ailing Tore Bobe, making strong ‘revelations’ if not allegations. “Some officials here engage in what I can call match fixing. They help players in betting against the team as well as colluding with other team managers from other clubs which I would not mention now but I’ll mention later, where they receive money from them to ensure that Shabana lose. I am working with DCI and other agencies to bring this criminals to book. I have evidence where one of our player was sent Sh5,000 to aid the other team win. In fact ten players are implicated,” he revealed. “We are going to clean Shabana off these kind of people and once the transfer window is open, all these players are going to be sent packing and get honest players that have the team at heart and the spirit of the game. And for the officials, they have to be shown the door,” he said. At the wake of Mayieko’s suspension, a group of fans calling themselves Shabana crew, waged into the turbulence claiming several things that they alleged are reasons behind the poor results.
