Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi A suspect accused of killing human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others three years ago  now wants the court to stop the prosecution from using a statement, in which he reportedly confessed to the killings. Peter Ngugi alias Brown yesterday told trial judge Jessie Lesiit he did not understand the implications of the same and was coerced to do so. He claimed he was forced to sign some documents which he did not understand as he is a Class Four dropout. Ngugi also said he was a police informant since 2009. However, things changed in 2016, when he was arrested and charged alongside four administration police officers with the murder of lawyer Kimani, his client Josephat Mwendwa and driver Joseph Muiruri. In the case, four police officers, Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and Ngugi are said to have abducted Kimani and four others as they exited Mavoko Law Courts on June 23, 2016. Bodies of Kimani and two others were found in Oldonyo Sabuk river days after they were reported missing.
