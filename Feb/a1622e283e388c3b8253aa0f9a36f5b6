The court yesterday suspended the ongoing nurses’ strike for 60 days, and called for talks between their union, Labour ministry and the county governments. Council of Governors (CoG) moved to court yesterday to challenge the legitimacy of the ongoing strike, which has left patients across the country with few or no nurses to attend to them. “We, therefore, call upon Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) to call off the strike as ordered by the court to allow the conciliation process to be concluded,” said CoG chair Wycliffe Oparanya. Labour Cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani formed a conciliatory team last week on Friday, to come up with a lasting solution, but Knun has opposed the move, saying the return-to-work formula was agreed on in the presence of all stakeholders. A spot check by People Daily showed that patients had to bear  long queues at Mbagathi Hospital, Nairobi, to be served by the few nurses, who had not downed their tools. A similar situation was witnessed at Mama Lucy Hospital. Knun secretary general Seth Panyako said the strike is still on and nurses will only return to work when the agreed deal is honoured. Panyako said West Pokot, Kisumu, Nairobi, Kisii, Elgeyo Marakwet, Wajir, Taita taveta, Transzoia counties are still on strike. However, he said Nairobi and Kisii counties are in talks with the union to end the strike. In Mandera, Vihiga, Tharaka Nithi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kitui and Kiambu counties, the strike has been suspended as the county governments  have committed to paying the allowances by end of the month.
