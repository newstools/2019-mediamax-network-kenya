Deputy President William Ruto has warned individuals or groups that claim to be campaigning for his 2022 presidential bid. Ruto said he has not sactioned anyone to form such groups and told them not to involve his name in their plans. “It has come to the attention of the Deputy President that there are individuals and/or groups who are purporting to be mobilising support connected to his 2022 presidential campaign. “At no time has the Deputy President approved, canvassed or engaged in any other form of preparation for a presidential or other campaign after the last presidential election,” read a statement by his Communication secretary David Mugonyi. Ruto asked those who are running such campaigns to use their energy more productively and those funding the groups to find better use for their resources. Mugonyi said the DP was working towards the realisation of Jubilee’s agenda, particularly President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. Several groups have emerged in parts of the country, including Nairobi, Vihiga and West Pokot claiming to be moblising support for the DP in readiness to the 2022 elections.
