Seth Onyango @SethManex The Civil Society Reference Group (CSRG) has called for prosecution of Kenya Forest Service (KFS) rangers who assaulted four journalists from Mediamax and Royal Media Services. It comes just two days after acting Chief Conservator of Forests Monica Kalenda interdicted the three officers involved in the assault. Environment Cabinet secretary Keriako Tobiko had also ordered their interdiction. The journalists, Seth Mwaniki and Wahu wa Ngugi (Mediamax), Emilio Muriithi (Citizen TV) and Martin Munene (Inooro TV) were attacked after filming chaos that erupted at a meeting in Naro Moru forest. CSRG presiding convener Churchill Suba (pictured) urged Directorate of Public Prosecutions to probe the incident and ensure the officers involved are punished. “KFS officers should be prosecuted and jailed for causing bodily harm to journalists who were on duty exercising their right as protected in the Constitution to seek, access and impart information to the public,” he said. He argued that the forest is gazetted and a public resource hence the accused officers cannot claim that the journalists trespassed in a public forest station. “It is not enough to interdict the marauding forest officers. They must be prosecuted and if found guilty jailed to serve as a lesson to others who have in the past assaulted journalists with impunity,” Suba said.
