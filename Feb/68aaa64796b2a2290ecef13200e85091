Istanbul, Tuesday Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he had not yet seen an acceptable plan from the United States for the creation of a safe zone in northeastern Syria, three weeks after President Donald Trump suggested establishing the zone. “There is no satisfactory plan that is put before us concretely yet,” Erdogan told a parliamentary meeting of his AK Party. “Of course we are loyal to our agreements, our promise is a promise. But our patience is not limitless.” Turkey wants to set up the safe zone with logistical support from allies and says it should be cleared of the US—backed Kurdish YPG militia which Ankara considers a terrorist group. The safe zone will be an issue at a meeting on Wednesday in the US of ministers from a coalition of countries fighting the Islamic State militant group. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will attend those talks. In December, Trump confounded his own national security team with a surprise decision to withdraw all 2,000 US troops from Syria. -Agency
