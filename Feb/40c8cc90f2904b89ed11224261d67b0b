Leaders from the Kisii community have come to the defence of Chief Justice David Maraga from attacks by some senators  for attending a presidential function. Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri said  Maraga had not committed any crime by attending the President’s function  held  in his Kisii home backyard and dismissed those who were dragging his name into politics. He particularly took issue with the Senate Minority LeaderJames Orengo and the Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula, saying they misinterpreted the CJ’s presence at the event. “I was there and at no time did Maraga talk politics when he was given a chance to greet his village people,” said Ongeri. He said claims by the senators that Maraga embarrassed the Judiciary were baseless because the CJ also has a right to interact with Kenyans irrespective of their social, economical and political status.
