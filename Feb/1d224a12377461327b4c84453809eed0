Petroleum prices have now fallen to a new low after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) cut prices by up to Sh4 a litre in the latest price review, thanks to the recent slide in international oil prices that have been falling since October last year. International rates of fuels ordinarily follow the crude price trend – which has tumbled to under $72 (Sh7,212) a barrel from slightly over $86 (Sh8,614.4) in October last year. Such reverse adjustments on global crude oil prices generally drive down local fuel rates that has now been seen in the last three months. Motorists in Nairobi will for the next one month pay Sh100.09 for a litre of petrol, down from Sh104.21 last month and Sh113.54 they had been paying since December 14 – marking a three-month low. The cost of a litre of diesel has also fallen by Sh6.28 to retail at Sh95.96 in the city. Kerosene will retail at Sh96.50 in Nairobi, a drop from Sh101.7 last month. The commission further attributed the otherwise anticipated shrinkage to the softening global crude prices which saw the average landed cost of imported super petrol dropping by 7.23 per cent from $590.92 (Sh59,190.68) per tonne in December to $543.2 (Sh54,410.71) per tonne in January, while diesel prices dropped by 11.29 per cent from $615.97 (Sh61,699.87) to $546.42 (Sh54,733.25) per tonne and Kerosene lessening by 3.92 per cent from $620.05 (Sh62,108.55) to $595.75 (Sh59,674.49) per tonne, which explains the fall in pump prices. Motorists in Mombasa will buy a litre of petrol at Sh97.46 from Sh101.60, Sh93.96 for diesel and Sh 93.88 for a litre of kerosene.
