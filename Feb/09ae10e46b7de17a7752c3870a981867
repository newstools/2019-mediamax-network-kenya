The Senators include those from the Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights, the National Security and Foreign Relations and the National Cohesion, Equal Opportunity and Regional Integration committees. Eight months after the tragedy that killed 48 people, several questions remain unanswered on its cause. An ad hoc committee formed by  the Senate accused top government officials failing to deliver justice to victims and their families. Yesterday, Senators questioned why recommendations made by the House have not been acted upon. “The restoration order is still in the shelves as the residents suffer. It’s a classic conspiracy between the elite against the people,” said Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior, who chaired the ad hoc committee. Nakuru senator Susan Kihika accused implementing agencies of refusing to implement the report. “I am also disappointed for inaction by the government to implement the Solai report. For the first time, individuals and authorities were held culpable,” Kihika, who is also the Majority Whip said.
