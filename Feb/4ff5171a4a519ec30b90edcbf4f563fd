Kinyuru Munuhe and Wangu Gacheche @PeopleDailyKe The ongoing vetting of licenced civilian firearm holders has been thrown into disarray after a tiff between the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and Mathari hospital medical staff. Hospital superintendent Joseph Jumba suspended evaluation of licenced gun holders, who have been undergoing psychiatric tests. On Friday, EACC detectives undertook  an operation to bust a suspected corruption syndicate at Mathari hospital, where some medical officers were allegedly demanding bribes from the gun holders undergoing mandatory mental tests. One medic was arrested and  taken to Integrity Center to record a statement but was later released. “You are hereby informed that the above exercise has been suspended until further notice. Apologies for any inconveniences caused,” Jumba said via an internal memo. EACC officials termed the raid a “botched operation”, saying the key suspects escaped after being tipped-off. The sleuths visited the facility after complaints of bribery demands from licensed gun holders,  being vetted by the Firearm Licensing Board. After clearance the board, those eligible will be issued with a smart card license detailing their biometrics. Authorised civilian firearm holders were given up to March 18 to acquire special identification cards introduced by the Interior ministry.
