The Kwale County Secretary Martin Mwaro has said he does not know the whereabouts of the mayoral chain that was used by the chairman during the defunct county council. Speaking on a phone interview with People Daily, Mwaro said he has never heard about it since he came into office in 2013. “Honestly, I do not know anything about that chain and have never heard about it since I came in office in 2013 but I think the county Assembly Speaker Sammy Ruwa is in a better position to answer,” said Mwaro. Interim officials The secretary said he was part of the interim officials of the Transition Authority (TA) team in Kwale county, and that they received a list of the assets and liabilities used during the defunct county council, but the mayoral chain was not in the list. “I was part of the interim officials of the TA in Kwale and in the list of assets that were used during the defunct county council, the chain was missing. We never heard anything concerning that chain and so we didn’t ask,” he said. Speaker Ruwa said when he took over office in 2013, he just found a few symbols of power that had been handed over to the then Clerk but the chain was not among them. “ I have asked a few staff that were in the defunct council about the chain but none of them remembers seeing it,” he said. Ruwa said they will do a formal inquiry into whether the chain existed. Assets available However the former chairman of the defunct Kwale county council Mshenga Vuyaa Ruga said the mayoral chain and the gown were there and as they were approaching the 2013 General Elections the two assets were handed over to the Clerk of the County Assembly. He said the mayoral chain was an English Gold jewellery whose cost was around Sh1.5 million.  “The gown was also expensive, both the gown and the chain had a cost of Sh7.5 million,” he said.
