The Mathare youth mobiliser Billian Okoth Ojiwa yesterday assured his family that he was well a day after his wife reported him missing. Reports indicated that Ojiwa, who is also the Kanu Youth Congress chairman, contacted his family, which had earlier visited Kilimani Police Station to report his disappearance. “We have invited him to come and tell us where he was,” a detective privy to the investigations said. Ojiwa’s wife, Nerima, said he went missing on Sunday and attempts to reach him were futile because his phone was switched off. Reports indicate the police have extracted Ojiwa’s phone data record to establish whether he had received any threats. Kanu Youth Congress National executive director Joseph Towett confirmed that the family was in contact with him. “The information we have is that Billian is in touch with the family members and the same has been reported to the police. We would like give police time to find out the circumstances that came out of the social media circulation,” Towett said. Police are suspecting possibility of family disagreements, as one of the reasons Ojiwa walked away since he left all his belongings, including phone and car keys at his wife’s parent’s house. “We found Billian thank you so much,” Nerima said on her Facebook page without giving details.  Ojiwa unsuccessfully ran for Mathare parliamentary seat in 2013.  He is also known for the Ficha Uchi Initiative, a programme which donates school uniform to needy children. Ojiwa initiated the Ficha Uchi campaign in February 2015 after a teacher asked him to help obtain school uniform for some five pupils in his school who wore torn uniforms.
