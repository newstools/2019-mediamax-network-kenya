Irene Githinji @gitshee The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has dismissed at least 29 tutors over professional misconduct. One of the major reasons for their removal was sexual offences, which the TSC has been condemning, against the backdrop of increased cases of pregnancies in schools. Thus, the 29 can no longer offer teaching services in any school in the country, public or private. Their dates of removal range between June and November last year. “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 30 of the TSC Act Chapter 212 of the laws of Kenya, the Commission wishes to notify the public that the persons whose names are specified in the schedule herein have been removed from the register of teachers,” read a gazette notice signed by TSC Secretary Nancy Macharia. A list of the teachers recommended for gazettement has been attached, with the TSC indicating their TSC number, case number and their date of removal. The gazette notice indicates that provisions of Sections 23 and 30 of the TSC Act provide that, where the name of any teacher is removed from the register under the Act, such name shall not be reinstated except by direction of the Commission. Similarly, a teacher whose name has been removed from the register ceases to be a teacher with effect from the date of such removal and should not engage in the teaching service unless registered under the Act.
