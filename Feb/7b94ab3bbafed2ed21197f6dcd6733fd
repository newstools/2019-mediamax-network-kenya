Mutiga Murimi @murimimutiga Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has asked youth not to hide under the guise of unemployment to join terrorist groups. He said lack of employment was a global problem that can be dealt with through creativity and innovation. The governor asked the youths to be patriotic and engage in meaningful economic activities instead of leaving the country to join illegal groups such as al Shabaab. “We went through similar frustrations after high school because there were no jobs then but the youth of that time did not join criminal groups, although unemployment was still rampant,” he said during the launch of Tana River County action plan in Hola town. The governor’s sentiments came after some Members of the County Assembly blamed unemployment for the high number of youths joining criminal groups such as al Shabaab militia.
