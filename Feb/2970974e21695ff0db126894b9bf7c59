Normally, I am a quiet barman. A nice chap you can entrust your deepest secrets with. Never one of those mtaani loud-mouthed bartenders who poke their stinky noses into customers’ affairs as if they are their designated guardian angels. But this does not mean I do not see a lot and make much of it. I do, but my policy of see no evil, hear no evil and talk no evil is the best work practice in this line. The turning a blind eye strategy must be working, otherwise, by now, I would have called my best customer, Baba Edu, and tipped him that his favourite girlfriend (favourite because out of his four-side chics, she is the apple of his eye) is also a favourite damsel for a certain MCA, also my loyal customer. But sometimes, even the most guarded barman suffers from the occasional slip of the tongue in the quest to impress a customer. There is a balding man who runs a number of chemists in the city. Almost in his late 50’s, he loves his beer almost as much as as he does the harem of ladies he constantly keeps and entertains. On Valentine’s Day, after enjoying a sumptuous six-course dinner with a new catch at a restaurant not far away from my pub, he offered to have one for the road with the date of the day. The woman looked the act; a gorgeous face and massive derriere hinged on a wasp-like waist which the man of the hour could not resist coiling his arm about. I served the duo, who seemed at home in each other’s company, despite some misplaced pecks and uncomfortable public touches on some not so public zones. The man then asked for something to eat and my “innocent” inquiry “Mzee tuwekelee tumbukiza kama kawaida?” (Shall we prepare boiled meat as usual?) abruptly brought the date to an end. The woman’s eyes almost popping out of their sockets, snapped “James I thought you had told me you have never been to this club and this is your first time!  I don’t like liars and since this is where you bring your other women, I am off. Enjoy tumbukiza alone!”
