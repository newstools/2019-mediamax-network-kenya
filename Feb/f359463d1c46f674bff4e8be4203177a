Yusuf Masibo @PeopleDailyKe One person was seriously injured when Ford Kenya and ODM supporters clashed at a funeral in Matili village, Kimilili constituency. Supporters of Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and those of ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna engaged in fist fight, disrupting the programme for the burial of  businesswoman Eunice Lumonya. Trouble started when Sifuna accused some Luhya leaders of failing to help the  family of Dini ya Musambwa founder, the late Elijah Wanameme.  Sifuna praised ODM leader Raila Odinga for aiding the family members, who travelled from Kimilili to Nairobi to seek help. “Wanameme’s family had financial constrains and had to travel to Nairobi to look for Raila despite our local leaders being around,” he said. Exhibit tolerance These sentiments angered Ford Kenya supporters leading to a verbal exchange within the VIP dais  and a fist fight between the supporters of the two sides Wangamati (pictured) and Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa had to intervene to end the fight. The duo condemned the incident and urged supporters of different parties and leaders to exhibit tolerance. However, Barasa accused Sifuna of failing to learn about the crowd and their differences. Sifuna also condemned the act,  saying such political intolerance should not be accepted in the community, and asked residents to shun leaders, who encourage hooliganism.
