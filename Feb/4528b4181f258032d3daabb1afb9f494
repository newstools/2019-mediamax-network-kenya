Amos Abuga World Cross-Country champion Geoffrey Kamworor, has conceded lack of decisiveness cost him the title during Saturday’s National Cross Country Championship the Eldoret Sports Club. Steeplechase whizz Amos Kirui, who upset two-time World Cross Country champion Kamworor, for the national bragging rights was the fairytale of the national championships-cum-trials. Kamworor who clocked 30:03.9 for a fifth place finish will not withstanding represent Kenya in Aarhus, Denmark, as one of the top six finishers. For a flat race that had mud barriers and two haystacks points of obstacles, choosing the right to break was always going to be the icebreaker in a race that had a galaxy of bigwigs. “I will not take anything away from the champion, Amos Kirui, he run a calculated race, credit to him,” said Kamworor who was representing the National Police Service. “My body does well when running down and up hills, therefore I was going to need more energy to for the long run,” the former national champion said. In an after race assessment, Kamworor, confessed having World U20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto, 2016 World U20 10,000m Rodgers Kwemoi, U18 3,000m champion Richard Yator in the leading pack by the half-way mark was an early indicator to take action, which he never did. “At one point I felt that I was the pace-setter in the race, that did contribute to my wearing out later in the race. Just after the final two kilometres mark, I notice none was willing to take charge. I did and it cost me,” said he.
