How did you come about this car? They say that you can’t be a real petrolhead if you have never owned an Alfa Romeo. Back in the day my father used to work on Alfa Romeos every day. He had an intense passion for these cars, but as life goes, we came along and due to some financial difficulties at that time he was unable to afford one. One weekend  when we were just chilling with the family he started talking about the Alfas. He spoke so passionately, praising it and I can remember that it brought tears to his eyes that he didn’t have one. That say I decided that I would get one for him. I finally found this beauty and rebuilt it for him. On my 21st birthday, he gave it back to me as a present. We can say that it’s a family heirloom. What do you like most about it? The special thing about this car is that it’s an Alfa, ask anyone who has driven one and you will understand. Alfas are built and design with passion. Everything from the engine, the power and the perfectly sculpted lines evokes a certain Italian charm that is unique and this one especially I think looks very good. It has a H4 boxer engine with twin Webber carburettors and once you mash the throttle the push is just insane, its gear shifts are smooth and it’s just a pleasure to drive. Even in fifth you still feel like it wants another gear, it has got so much go! Any downsides? They are very sentimental cars, one day it will be running fine and the next day it will have mood swings and be uncooperative. So you have to be very patient with them and as you would with a beautiful Italian girl, you have to say sweet words to her. As you would expect with such a car it is also quite difficult to get the parts, even in Europe and even when you do get them they are very expensive.
