Hundreds of wild animals from a private conservancy have been displaced following a wild fire that destroyed thousands of acres of vegetation in Gilgil. More than 3,000 acres of vegetation went up in flames in Kagio Conservancy along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway that borders the Gilgil weighbridge. This came as Kenya Wildlife Service called on residents in the area to be mindful of wild animals straying from the expansive conservancy to their farms following the overnight inferno. Gilgil Deputy County Commissioner Mutheki Ndambuki said initial investigations into the fire pointed to some herders who had lit fire to keep warm while grazing on one end of the conservancy.
