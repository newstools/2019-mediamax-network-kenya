Four persons have been arrested in connection with theft of medical supplies and equipment  at  Machakos County Referral Hospital. During the Thursday morning sting operation, led by Machakos District Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO)  Rhoda Kanyi,  assorted drugs, laboratory reagents, X-ray films and clinical medical gear emblazoned with Government batch number and labels were recovered in two private clinics located in a building opposite the hospital. Governor Alfred Mutua witnessed the swoop.The two facilities were closed down indefinitely as detectives intensified investigations. A few hours after the swoop, the  Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) directed Executive Committee Member (ECM) for Health Ruth Mutua, the chief officer Jackson Nthanga and medical superintendent, Hellen Nzuki to record a statement over the matter. The incident brought business to near standstill in the town. “It is bad that these people have no mercy on us as poor residents of the county, how the drugs bearing Government of Kenya (GOK) and Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa) stamps and several other medical gear find  their way to a private clinics?” posed Musyimi Paul, a member of the public. Medical staff manning the facilities could not explain the origin of the equipment. Some of them were also found to be unqualified.
