Philip Onyango The Ugenya parliamentary by-election has attracted six candidates, including immediate former MP Christopher Karan whose election was nullified by the Supreme Court. Also eyeing the seat is David Ochieng of the Movement for Democracy and Growth who successfully petitioned Karan’s election in the 2017 General Election. Others in the race are Daniel Juma (Grand Dream Development Party), Brian Omondi, (Thirdway Alliance) Joseph Mburu of the National Vision Party and William Branham Sind, an Independent candidate. The contestants’ agents who met IEBC officials at Sega Youth Polytechnic yesterday were urged to ensure they abide by the law during the campaigns. The candidates are scheduled to present nomination papers to the Returning Officer on February 4 while the election will be held on April 5.
