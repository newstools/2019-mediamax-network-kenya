Irene Githinji @gitshee Isiolo Woman Representative Rehema Jaldesa has defended her proposal to chop off sexual offenders’ private parts, saying it would only apply to those found guilty of the offence. She said increasing cases of defilement were alarming and time has come to introduce radical measures to curb the vice. Earlier this week, the legislator proposed the amendment of Section 43 of the Sexual Offences Act to introduce tougher and punitive measures against defilement. Section 43 of the Act stipulates that sexual offenders be imprisoned for at least 10 years if found guilty of the offence, which is lenient according to the MP. Jaldesa, who is also the Pastoralist Parliamentary Group (PPG) secretary general,  said she is optimistic that her proposal will sail through in Parliament despite some of the opposition she is already receiving. “It is time we say enough is enough. Several people have agreed to support me. Cases of defilement with some victims left for dead are rising at an alarming level. Everyday, news are filled with stories of defilement even by people, who are supposed to protect girls,” she said. Jaldesa made the remarks after a PPG meeting at a Nairobi hotel. The group also vowed to fight retrogressive practices and ensure pastoralist women’s priorities are promoted. “I insist that those guilty of this offence should be castrated. A good example is Saudi Arabia where there is no theft because of instance justice such as the hand being cut off. We must introduce those radical measures too,” she said. She said she opted for the proposal as alternative ways have been tested and tried but they seem not to yield fruits. “Parliament has men who they are brothers or husbands, some of them have daughters and those being defiled are spread across the country. I do not see why they should not support the proposal unless they have ill intentions, after all, I did not say that innocent people be punished,” she said.
