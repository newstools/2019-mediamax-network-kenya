Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Senate Majority Whip Susan Kihika wants governors serving their second terms to stop early 2022 succession politics and instead focus on serving the electorate. Kihika has urged the county bosses to ensure resources assigned to the devolved units are well utilised. In an interview with People Daily on Monday, the Nakuru senator said governors are putting the country in an unnecessary campaign mode at the expense of development. At least four governors, including Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and his vice chair Mwangi wa Iria of Murang’a, have announced their intention to vie for the Presidency in 2022. Others with similar ambitions are Machakos’ Alfred Mutua and Hassan Joho of Mombasa. “I urge governors to stop putting the country in early campaigns and concentrate on service delivery,” said Kihika.She said Senate would continue to hold governors answerable and senators will not succumb to any political sideshows. Kihika, who was recently elected Bureau of Women Parliamentarians president, a caucus group under the Inter-Parliam-entary Union (IPU), regretted that some senators have in the past  faced hostility in their counties, as governors perceive them to be going for their jobs. She said the county bosses must continue to appear before Senate Public Accounts and Investment Committee (CPAIC) to answer audit queries. CPAIC, led by Senator Moses Kajwang, is expected to summon at least 23 governors, including James Ongwae (Kisii), Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Josphat Nanok (Turkana) and Amason Kingi (Kilifi).
