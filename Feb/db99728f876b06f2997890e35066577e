President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday attended a high-level board meeting of the Smart Africa Alliance Initiative that is working to digitise the economies and trade of 24 countries across the continent. Smart Africa Initiative Alliance aims to leverage technology to create a single digital market in a region that enjoys a population of over 600 million people. The President attended the initiative’s 5th board meeting on the margins of the 32nd Heads of State and Government Summit of the African Union currently underway in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Alliance is chaired by  President Paul Kagame of Rwanda who led yesterday’s session. Uhuru, who is a board member of the alliance, held brief side discussions with the Rwandan leader at the end of the board meeting before proceeding to other official engagements at the AU headquarters. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said the Heads of State have already instructed their respective central banks and communication regulators to put together a framework for mobile money transfer across the 24 states. He said that agenda under discussion during yesterday’s meeting included One Area Network, roaming in the 24 countries and the targeted reduction of costs of data in the member states to a low of eleven US cents per mega byte. The Smart Africa Alliance Initiative aims to leverage the progress registered in digital connectivity since the Connect Africa Summit held last year and use technology to reduce poverty, enhance participation, improve service delivery and create prosperity for the 600 million people in the 24-nation economy. –PSCU
