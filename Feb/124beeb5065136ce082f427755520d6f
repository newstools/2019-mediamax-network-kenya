KCB’s ‘Road to Karen’ opening leg set to be played at the par 72 Sigona Golf Club tomorrow has attracted at least 220 amateur golfers as the journey to booking six of the 30 tickets on offer to the prestigious Karen Masters Pro-Am tournament tees off. The ‘Road to Karen’ is a qualifying tourney for this year’s Karen Masters, which is a Sunshine Tour sanctioned event. The pro-am competition will be run in five Clubs across the country namely Nyali, Sigona, Thika, Nakuru and Royal. This weekend’s event will however exclude the professional golfers. KCB Bank, during the launch of the five tournaments announced a Sh 2million prize kitty for the local for the four events they will take part in. The prize money for the Pros will be split on a 60/40 ratio. The 60 percent will be prize money for the top 15 finishers while the 40 percent is set aside for those who meet the set scores for the different courses. The cut will be set at level par and better. With a new qualification format, the series adds considerable lure to the Pro-Am tournament that sees amateurs paired alongside top golfers drawn from across the globe. “The course is excellent and the greens are on a normal pace, with the current weather situation, we are expecting great day of golf,” said Muraya Kariuki, the golf captain at Sigona. Six winners from each of the participating clubs will get automatic qualification to play at the main event slated for June 25-30 at the Karen Country Club.
