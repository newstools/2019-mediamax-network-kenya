Hillary Mageka and Mercy Mwai @PeopleDailyKe Cabinet and Principal secretaries and parastatal chiefs who are members of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) risk being deregistered from the roll of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (CPA-K) if they are convicted of corruption charges, should a proposal to Parliament go through. Also targeted are company secretaries, county secretaries, County Executive Committee members (CECs) and Chief Officers. ICPAK wants the Senate and the National Assembly to ratify the proposal to discipline rogue public and State officials who fail to comply with requirements of Public Finance Management Act that includes failure to file annual general audit reports to the Auditor General’s office. The institution wants powers to institute disciplinary action against the officers, including compelling their employers to fire them. In the proposals to the sessional Senate Committee on County Public Accounts and Investment (CPAIC), the institute suggests that auditors entrusted with managing public resources should have some level of accountability. In an interview with People Daily, ICPAK chairman Edwin Makori said the proposal is meant to end graft and bring sanity to management of public finance. “It will be no longer be business as usual. Our members who are entrusted with public finance must adhere to our code of ethics, but if they perpetuate corruption, action must now be taken,” said Makori. CPAIC chairperson Moses Kajwang’ told ICPAK to strike out rogue members who violate the provisions of public management from its register. Kajwang’, the Homa Bay senator, said like lawyers, accountants must be answerable to the public and the governments they serve in. “Just like attorneys who sometimes mishandle their clients’ cases in court and are reported for disciplinary action at the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), it is time accountants are held responsible for their acts of omissions while in office,” he said.
