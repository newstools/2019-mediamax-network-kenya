Iranian ambassador to Kenya Haji Farajvand has denied claims he was trying to secure the release of two terror suspects from custody. Instead, the envoy accused unnamed people of blackmailing him for the role he has played in expanding trade between Kenya and his country. “I am encouraging Kenyan authorities to work closely with my government to identify reasons why Kenyan tea cannot be exported directly to Iran,” the envoy said yesterday. Particularly, Farajvand highlighted the recent progress where the Iranian government signed a deal to help Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) develop its nanotechnology field. “It is highly suspected that these accusations are coming just one week after my government offered to help JKUAT develop her nanotechnology. We have agreed on seven items among them; offer the institution’s lecturers, instructors and students scholarships to study nanotechnology in Iran; and also help put up a fully equipped laboratory at the university,” Farajvand said at the Iranian Embassy without naming the persons he suspects of sabotage. Nanotechnology or Nanoscience is the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. This is the fourth year since he was assigned to Kenya, and the second time in less than one year he is responding to accusations of trying to secure the release of terror suspects. He demanded an apology from media and any persons involved in the publication of the story in a section of both local and international media. “I am asking all the people who have participated in the publication (of) this defamatory article to put up an apology. This has put my family and me in great disrepute. We have suffered great character assassination since the story was published,” he added.
