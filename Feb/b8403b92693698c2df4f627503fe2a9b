It all started as mere murmurs but they soon grew into grapevine before a section of media houses picked it up. Allegedly, there is a cartel that has surrounded Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho that has been reaping from artistes hard work. One of them is Pilipili FM’s Eric Mgenge Gates, who hosts the Youth Show. According to a section of Coast based artistes, Gates who has been a close ally of the Governor, is said to have presented himself and a few other individuals in view of representing artistes interests, a move that saw them get tenders and payments meant for artistes after gigs. “These are just laughable allegations because how can one con a whole governor? I also know that he has artistes interests at heart, but I dont think it it possible to con him. What they should be telling us is what they really want because I know they also have their own agenda which they are not speaking of,” he told PD Wikendi via phone.
