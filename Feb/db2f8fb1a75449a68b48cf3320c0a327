Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi National Treasury is to blame for the slow pace of  development in counties, chairperson of the Commission on Administrative Justice Florence Kajuju has said. Speaking in Eldoret town yesterday, Kajuju defended governors over minimal spending on key development projects in the counties. She accused the National government of withholding billions of shillings earmarked for social and economic development at the devolved units. “Governors  have been accused of slow pace of development projects in counties yet it is the National Treasury which is the cause of woes facing the regional governments because of delays in disbursing funds,” she said. Kajuju made the remarks after paying a courtesy call to Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. The former Meru Woman Rep was accompanied by members of the commission; Lucy Ndung’u and Washington Opiyo. Also present was deputy governor Daniel Chemno and some Uasin Gishu Members of the County Assembly. Mandago said his administration has been accused of non-performance by the electorate owing to stalled projects they launched two years ago in six sub-counties because of  lack of funds. “We are under constant attack and ridicule from the people who elected us in office for failing to complete the projects we launched because of National Treasury’s delay to disburse money on time,” said Mandago. Kajuju said that she will utilise her weeklong tour of North Rift region to hold meetings with stakeholders to enlighten residents  on how they can make use of the Ombudsman office in addressing myriad of challenges  facing them. “Many people especially those in rural areas continue to suffer all manner of injustices because they do not know anything about the office of Ombudsman and its mandate,”she said. She said that her commission will pile pressure on the executive to compel the National Treasury to hasten the process of disbursing of money to the regional governments.
