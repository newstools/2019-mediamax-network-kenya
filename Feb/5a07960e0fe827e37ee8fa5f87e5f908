Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has asked the National government to ensure families affected by the ongoing construction of Kibwezi-Kitui road are compensated in time. She said key stakeholders should fast-track fair compensation of the land owners in the project area as failure to do so will derail construction of the road. The governor spoke in her office yesterday when she met Kitui County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti and Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) officials led byÂ  chairman Eng Erastus Mwongera to discuss the progress of the project.
