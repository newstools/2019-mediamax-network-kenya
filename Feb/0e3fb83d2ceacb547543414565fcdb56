Some of the National Youth Service (NYS) suspects facing various graft charges could soon be “free” if they agree to enter a plea bargain agreement, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has said. He said his office is keen on a concept which would see the suspects return the stolen loot and pay a fine before being set free. “We are working with Family Bank on the issue of plea-bargain and some NYS suspects as this practice will help offset some of these graft cases,” he said. The DPP at the same time confirmed that the DCI had finished investigating Equity, KCB, Standard Chartered, Diamond Trust and Co-operative banks to check if there were any illegalities in their involvement. “DCI has made his recommendations in relation to the files and we expect to take measures which may include charging individuals in court from next week,” he said. On his part, the Chief Justice David Maraga welcomed the plea-bargain concept saying it will help in the recovery of stolen assets. “If a suspect charged with corruption agrees to pay back and return the stolen assets, then the Judiciary would not have any problem with this,” he said. This emerged when they spoke yesterday in Naivasha during a National Council on Administration of Justice workshop.
