Alvin Mwangi, Seth Mwaniki and  Sophie Njoka @PeopleDailyKe Talks to avert the ongoing strike called by nurses working in four referral hospitals in Nairobi ended in a  deadlock yesterday  as the medical workers insisted they would  only resume duties after the return-to-work formula is fully implemented. Their  hardline  stand has seen patients suffer in hospitals across the country was arrived at yesterday after a Health ministry meeting with union officials failed to bear fruit. Sources from the union who were in the meeting intimated to People Daily that the government said it has no money to meet their demands. The meeting  chaired by Health PS Peter Tum was attended by representatives of nurses working in Mathari National Hospital, National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital, National blood and the ports health department. In Nyeri, the  nurses  called off the seven- day strike after  fruitful deliberations between the county government and Nyeri branch Kenya National Union of Nurses officials. The two parties  agreed by  consensus to  terminate  the strike and anchored it on the  official position that will be taken by the  Salaries and Remuneration Commission on their grievances. In Mombasa, nurses are set to withdraw the  11-day strike notice after they began receiving their delayed allowances yesterday. Knun  Mombasa branch secretary Peter Maroko said a number of nurses had received their dues for uniform allowances amounting to Sh26,000 and nursing service allowance of Sh21,000 and were awaiting for the dues to reflect in their bank accounts.
