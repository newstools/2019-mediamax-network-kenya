Nyanza Regional coordinator for Education Richard Changawal has urged the area’s Kenya Secondary School Games Association officials to ensure that age cheating and fielding of non eligible players is completely eradicated during this year’s sporting activities. Speaking during a-three-day Nyanza Region training for referees and coaches at Kisumu Day Seconday School, Changawal said strict measures will be enforced to deal with such vices. “Age cheating and unethical fielding of non-eligible players is becoming common and must now come to an end,” he said, while urging sports officials to ensure best practices are observed to help in promoting genuine talents among the youth. “These unethical practices have seen talented students being locked out of school games and their positions taken by non-deserving people masquerading as students,” he added. The three-day training, which targeted secondary school teachers from the region, saw over 1,000 participants receive coaching and refereeing tips. Interpretation of the rules of the game, officiating and match management tips were also given. Teachers from Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii and Nyamira attended the seminar and were trained in hockey, basketball, handball, athletics, rugby, volleyball, netball, football, swimming and racquet games. Handball attracted over 150 participants, causing an unprecedented strain on resources. The clinic comes ahead of the start of this year’s term one games which kicks off with grassroots championships next week. The term one games, that will be played under the new rules, will feature basketball, handball, hockey, rugby 15s and sevens, athletics, swimming and cross-country. Nyanza Region term one games will take place from March 18-23 in  Homa Bay County.
