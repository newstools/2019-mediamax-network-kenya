Hillary Mageka @PeopleDailyKe Senators have turned the heat on Chief Justice David Maraga accusing him of exposing the Judiciary to humiliation and public ridicule after he attended a political function presided by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Kisii yesterday. Led by Senate Minority Leader James Orengo, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula and his Nandi counterpart Samson Cherargei, the lawmakers accused  Maraga of bringing dishonour to a profession honoured worldwide. “This is bad for the Judiciary.  Maraga must be told there were some Chief Justices in this country that were more executive but never appeared in a political rallies,” Orengo said. “We feel embarrassed with Chief Justice. I will mobilise my colleagues to pay a courtesy call to the CJ to tell him to stop the ignominy,” said Wetang’ula. Cherargei promised to take up the matter as on his capacity as Chair of Legal and Human rights committee to come up with methodologies to protect the office of the Chief Justice. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja cautioned his colleagues not to apportion blame on Maraga, saying  if all arms of government heads should not attend political functions, then  Speakers of the Senate and National Assembly should lead by example.
