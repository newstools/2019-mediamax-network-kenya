The  alleged murder of a woman by her husband and girlfriend continues to baffle many Kenyans. K24TV obtained CCTv footage and details of the investigations and put together a sequence of what could have happened on the day of the murder. Police sources say the footage incriminates  Judy Wangui, one of the murder suspects. Pictures taken just hours before the murder paint a very cordial relationship between the accused and the late Mary Wambui, raising the question; What could have made Wangui turn on Wambui?
