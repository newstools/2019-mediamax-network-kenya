Three football fans and players on the SportPesa gaming platform cashed in on their passion for the game on Monday morning when they received Sh8,819,633 each for splitting last week’s MidWeek Jackpot. Mechanic Jackson Gitahi from Murang’a County, farmer Nicholas Kirui from Kuresoi, Molo and Daniel Sumaili from Tassia, Embakasi received their cheques in Nairobi after winning an equal share of last week’s Sh26,458,899 Mid Week Jackpot for correctly predicting the outcome of all the select 13 games. Speaking after receiving his cheque in the company of his wife of nine years, Lilian Daniel, the elated Sumaili an ardent supporter of SportPesa Premier League side, Mathare United, revealed he was still coming to terms with his windfall. “Before I went to sleep, I had prayed to God to win since I had a feeling I had made the correct choices. I was at home in Kitui with my ailing mother where we were discussing on what to do next. “When I saw the text message at 1:19am I could not sleep any more.  After a while, I went to my mothers’ room and told her our troubles were over,” the 33- year-old father of a daughter narrated. Sumaili’s win came at the most opportune time having lost his job and unsuccessfully tried his hand in farming. “I decided to start playing on the SportPesa platform online when I heard people were winning big. I prayed hard this time and my wife was in Nairobi when it happened and we can now sit down and see how to improve our lives,” the newest millionaire who has been gaming on the platform since 2015 added.
