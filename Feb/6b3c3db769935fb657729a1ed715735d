Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua has effected mass transfers at Shauri Moyo Police Station, overhauling the operations and general duty command in the station. Out of the 64 officers moved in the mini-reshuffle, 37 are drawn from Shauri Moyo. Mbugua further ordered written explanations regarding six officers transferred from the same station between May and August last year and are yet to report to their new station. Mbugua’s action comes against the backdrop of an ongoing case involving a former Administration Police officer at the station who was accused of indecently assaulting a minor but  is yet to be charged despite recommendations to have him taken to court. “The Deputy Inspector General of the Kenya Police Service has approved the deployment of the following officers with immediate effect. Release the officers to report to their new stations by February 27, 2019. Submit casualty returns on departure or arrival.” A police correspondence dated February 20 says in part.  Those moved are in the ranks of sergeant, corporal and police constable.
