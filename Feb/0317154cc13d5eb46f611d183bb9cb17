London, Thursday @PeopleSport11 Athletics’ governing body has denied it will tell a court female athletes with high testosterone levels like Caster Semenya should be classified as male. World and Olympic 800m champion Semenya is challenging a proposed IAAF rule that aims to restrict the levels of testosterone in female runners. The case will be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) next week. The Times reported that IAAF lawyers will say Semenya is a “biological male” as well as classifed as female. The IAAF said it is “not classifying” any athlete with “differences of sexual development” (DSD) – of whom South African Semenya is the most notable – as male. “To the contrary, we accept their legal sex without question, and permit them to compete in the female category,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. “However, if a DSD athlete has testes and male levels of testosterone, they get the same increases in bone and muscle size and strength and increases in haemoglobin that a male gets when they go through puberty, which is what gives men such a performance advantage over women. “Therefore, to preserve fair competition in the female category, it is necessary to require DSD athletes to reduce their testosterone down to female levels before they compete at international level.”           – BBC
