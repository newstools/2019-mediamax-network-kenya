Ericson Kiprono @Peoplesport11 World junior 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto has exuded confidence that he will claim the World Cross-Country title. Kipruto, 20, is hopeful of overcoming the disappointment of missing out on Kenya’s team for the 2017 World Cross Country Championships Uganda by triumphing in this year’s edition in Aarhus, Denmark on March 30. He has already made his case by winning local and international events, the latest being the Discovery Kenya Cross Country Championships held in Eldoret a fortnight ago. “I have a title in the Africa Cross-Country Championships and my focus now is to win a world title in the race. It will be an uphill task but I believe in my training, my strength and my strategy,” said Kipruto. However, Kipruto reckons it will not be easy since the selection process will witness a host of big names square it out for slots at the National Trials on February 23 in Eldoret. “It is always a challenge to win a place in Team Kenya. However, I am determined and I will use the regional cross-country event in Maralal, Samburu County this weekend to fine-tune before the national selections,” said Kipruto. He will be battling it out with World Under-20 5,000m champion Edward Zakayo during the North Rift Regional cross-country championship. “There are talented Ugandans coming through the ranks. They train with us in Kenya and follow our disciplined routine. But I have to be smart and plan well,” added Kipruto. Uganda, Bahrain, Qatar and the Netherlands have their athletes pitching camp in Iten for training and will pose a great challenge to what has been a Kenyan and Ethiopian dominance in cross-country over the years.
