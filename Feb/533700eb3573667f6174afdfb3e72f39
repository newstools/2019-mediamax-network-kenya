Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti yesterday survived an election petition after the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the High Court and Court of Appeal to nullify his win. The top court upheld his election, faulting the two lower courts of ignoring a vote scrutiny report when they nullified Awiti’s victory. In judgment delivered by Justice Jackton Ojwang’, the Supreme Court observed that both courts’ decisions were not supported by evidence of the scrutiny report. Scrutiny disregard “The disregard of scrutiny by the trial court and the effective disregard by the appellate court was a grave error of law. The trial court had no reference points of judging  the magnitude of malpractice,” ruled Justice Ojwang’. According to the senior judges, Awiti was not given a fair hearing at the High Court due to lack of consideration of the scrutiny report. The top court noted that the scrutiny report would have ascertained whether there were irregularities and whether they   affected the results of the election.
