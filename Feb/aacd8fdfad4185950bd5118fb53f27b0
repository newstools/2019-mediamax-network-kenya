Douglas Dindi and Harrison Kivisu @PeopleDailyKe Three leaders have censured Wiper Democratic Movement party (WDM) leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) secretary general Francis Atwoli proposal to extend President Uhuru Kenyatta’s  tenure. Speaking separately, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua  said   such sentiments are not appropriate especially at this time when the country is embracing the Handshake. Addressing the press in Mombasa, he asked Kalonzo to support his 2022 presidential bid because his remark is a clear indication that he has abandoned the quest for the top seat. “The party does not support the proposal to remove presidential or Governors’ term limits. We have to be very careful not to go back to dictatorship,” he said. The comments were shared by Ford Kenya party’s secretary general Eseli Simiyu, who described the suggestion by the National Super Alliance (Nasa) co-principal at the weekend as pedestrian and mischievous. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli kicked off the debate last year when he claimed Uhuru Kenyatta was too young to retire. Simiyu speaking at Rosterman village in Kakamega asked whether the president’s retirement had become an issue for Kenyans.  “I’ve heard some of my colleagues say the president is too young to retire….Do they mean the president was unaware he has to retire after two-five year terms? And why should it be our problem now?  If his age would become a problem, why didn’t he wait until he is older to contest?” he posed. Ford-K leader Moses Wetang’ula, who was present steered clear of the issue, but instead spelled doom on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy saying that four development pillars, he want to be remembered for are a pipe dream.
