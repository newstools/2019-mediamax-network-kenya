Bernice Mbugua @bernicemuhindi Personal Assistant to Raila Odinga’s daughter Rosemary Odinga was yesterday charged with stealing Sh275,000 from her. John Oduor, who was charged alongside his wife Christine Anyango, is accused of committing the offence in November at Karen, Nairobi. Anyango is facing a separate charge of using another person’s identity card for fraudulent purposes. She allegedly registered a Safaricom SIM card and M-Pesa using the ID of a David Munyasia, an account they used to withdraw money from Ms Odinga. According to police, Rosemary reported on February 5 that she had noticed irregular withdrawals from her NIC account amounting to Sh275,000. Investigations revealed that Oduor called his wife, who operates an M-Pesa shop, and instructed her to register a Safaricom line for him in September. “The complainant is half-blind thus the first suspect helps her to make transactions from her NIC bank mobile banking application,” read the covering report.  According to the police report, Oduor, while helping Rosemary to make M-Banking transactions, sent money fraudulently to the new line between November to February. He later withdrew money from his wife’s M-pesa shop. He was arrested on Sunday by officers from Banking Fraud Investigations Department as he was reporting to work. He led the officers to his wife’s shop and she, too, was arrested.  Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi released both on a bond of Sh200,000 or a cash bail of Sh100,000.
