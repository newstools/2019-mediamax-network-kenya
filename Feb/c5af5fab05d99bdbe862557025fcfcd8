Anne Mwale and Mercy Rukwaro Kabazi Member of County Assembly Peter Mbae and his seven co-accused on Friday appeared before a Nakuru Court where they pleaded not guilty to charges of malicious destruction of property and arson. Resident Magistrate Yvonne Khatambi released them on a Sh200,000 bond each and further directed them not to conduct any public meetings or have contacts with witnesses in the case. Mbae, Samuel Ngang’a, Gitonga Nelson, Benson Mungai, Daniel Kamau, Samuel Kibaya, David Muniu and Michael Kabia were on Wednesday arrested and locked up at Menengai Police station following demonstrations that rocked Solai over compensation of the dam tragedy victims. On Friday, the court deferred their taking of plea and ordered that they be remanded at Njoro Police Station following a successful application by the prosecution supported by a sworn affidavit by Rongai Deputy Criminal Investigations Officer Dorcas Cherui. The prosecution had sought to have the suspects remanded in police custody for a further ten days on grounds that investigations were incomplete. But Khatambi said the State had not given compelling reasons for continued detention of the suspects. “The applicant has not demonstrated how the suspects may interfere with evidence if released on bond. They have failed to give satisfactory reasons why the eight should be denied bond,” she said. Defense lawyer Kipkoech Ngetich argued that his clients were holding a peaceful meeting with the victims of the Solai Dam tragedy that claimed 47 lives before police disrupted it. The eight further pleaded not guilty to charges of public disobedience and incitement to violence. The case will be mentioned on February 11.
