The Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) has decried rising cases of domestic homicides in the country and wants religious organisations and the government to join the campaign to tame the vice. Presbyterian Church Men Fellowship (PCMF) director Rev Henry Kaira attributed the increase in indents where men kill their spouses and children to neglect of the boy-child and lack of psycho-social support. Kaira, however, defended religions institutions against claims of failing in it duties of guiding the society, saying the rise in domestic violence needs a multi-faceted approach to tame. He said men are suffering psychologically and a majority succumb to deep mental illnesses owing to lack of psychosocial support by relevant institutions. He urged the government to develop policies that would protect boys from engaging in societal social vices such as drugs. He called on religious institutions in the country to create psychosocial support systems for men to curb social vices in the society. Kaira said there is need to ensure concerted efforts in addressing cases of social vices such as corruption and domestic violence, where men are mostly involved. The cleric spoke during the annual Presbyterian Church men fellowship themed “Growing Men of Integrity” held in Mombasa.
