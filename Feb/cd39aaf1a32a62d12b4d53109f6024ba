A UK based music company claimed to have taken ownership and copyrighted Kenya’s national anthem has denied doing so, raising concerns about Kenya’s ability to safeguard its heritage. In its defense, the Kenya Copyright board has assured there is nothing to worry about,  however, maintaining there is need to  amend  regulations to protect the anthem, against misuse after its copyright fell into the public domain on completing fifty years.
