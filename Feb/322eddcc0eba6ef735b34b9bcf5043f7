Baraka Karama @PeopleDailyKe Activists have seen yesterday’s landmark ruling by Kisumu Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo (below) as an indication of the government’s renewed effort in fighting impunity. The development follows a history of a misfiring Judiciary, especially when law enforcement officials are concerned. The most notable case was nine years ago, when the High Court acquitted constable Edward Kirui, who was caught on camera shooting two unarmed protesters at the peak of 2007 post-election violence in Kisumu’s Kondele area. Constable Kirui escaped the death penalty over a technical error involving prosecution evidence. Serial number During his trial, a mismatch by one digit in the serial number of the firearm tabled as exhibit saw the case thrown out. Kirui was accused of killing William Onyango and Ismael Chacha. Yesterday, magistrate Omollo, however, blamed the police for using excessive force in quelling the riots. Omollo blamed the chain of command for issuing orders that led to the death of three people in Kisumu county including six-months-old baby Samantha Pendo after the 2017 General Election.
