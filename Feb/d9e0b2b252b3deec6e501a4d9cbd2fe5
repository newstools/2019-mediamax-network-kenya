Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru’s function was yesterday called off after rowdy youth said to be allied to Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici stormed it. Waiguru was scheduled to preside over the issuing of cheques worth Sh16 million from the Women Enterprise Development Fund to 16 women groups. The meeting at Kerugoya Catholic Church Hall turned chaotic  after  Ngirici stormed the venue and accused the organisers of undermining her by not inviting her to the function. Speaking to the press, Ngirici said the Women Enterprise Development Fund falls in her purview and she should have been involved in the disbursement of the money. Accompanied by supporters, Ngirici forced her way into the hall and declared the meeting illegal. Cabinet Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Agenda Affairs Rachel Shebesh was expected to attend the function. About 700 women who had attended the meeting joined the fracas as county officials fled to safety with some hiding in their vehicles. Waiguru, who had not arrived when the chaos erupted, has been at loggerheads with Ngirici over various issues affecting the county. County commissioner Sam Onjwang accompanied by Kirinyaga Police commander Leah Kithii managed to restore order before calling off the meeting.
