Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The family of a Chinese woman who was killed by a hippo at the Lake Naivasha Country Club in 2013 was yesterday awarded Sh25.5 million as compensation. Justice Jacqueline Kamau awarded the family the amount, noting that it is the hotel’s responsibility to ensure all guests are protected. The deceased, 28-year-old Luo Yi, was attacked by a hippopo at Sun African Limited Hotel in Naivasha (trading as Lake Naivasha Country Club) on the night of her arrival at the hotel resulting to fatal injuries leading to her demise. The court was told that the deceased was walking along the paved walkway towards her cottage within the hotel compound accompanied by her female counterpart one Huang Ye when hippo with her calf attacked her. The hotel had claimed that Luo Yi was taking pictures of a hippo when she was attacked and that Kenya Wildlife was responsible for the wild animals. Kenya Wildlife Service  blamed both the hotel and the deceased saying Luo should not have wandered into an area she ought not to have, taking photos of the calf and playing with it. The judge, however, dismissed the argument that she was taking pictures of the hippo saying it was just hearsay because no one saw her. Justice Kamau said KWS was not responsible for private property and that the hotel ought to have called them when they realised the encroachment.
