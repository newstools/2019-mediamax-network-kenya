In high school, I was quit agile. I enrolled in the hockey team immediately after joining Form One, on some flimsy reason that I had to put into use the hockey stick I (and all other Form Ones) was forced to buy as part of the registration requirements. Daily practice on the pitch led me to become fit, and I did quite a bit of running, winning various marathons in and outside school. I remember one specific one organised by Nivea at Karura Forest, where I gave other contestants a run for their money and took home some expensive beauty goodies from the company, none of which I got to use, thanks to the older women in our house, but I digress. However, at some point (must be at sweet 16), the ‘hardiness’ that comes with being sporty started bothering me. The ‘masgwembes’, rough hands resulting from hockey stick handling and injury marks especially on the feet felt unladylike to me. I probably wasn’t invested in sports enough to sacrifice my ‘ladyness’ (remember my motivation to join in the first place?), and quitting it all was an easy decision to make. So, I perfectly understand that it can be a real dilemma among some women in sports. We caught up with one of them who was in the women’s national rugby team, and have the interesting piece as our main feature. Happy reading!
