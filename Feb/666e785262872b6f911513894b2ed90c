A Catholic priest attached to Magwagwa Parish in North Mugirango constituency, Nyamira, escaped death narrowly after angry faithful attempted to lynch him before the mass kicked off on Sunday. Father Walter Maticha sneaked through the back door of his residential house after a tip-off from some church faithful on the planned attack. The faithful reportedly wanted to beat him up over alleged sexual abuse before marching him to Bishop Joseph Mairura, who heads Kisii Diocese. The faithful, led by the parish committee chairman Nyangare Moturi,  accused the priest of sexually assaulting women and girls in the parish and mismanaging church funds. Police from Ekerenyo Divisional Headquarters intervened to prevent the angry faithful from causing any damage to the church property and the priest’s residence. Addressing the press yesterday, Moturi said faithful had complained about the priest’s conduct  several times but the church’s top leadership has failed to address their concerns. He said they have evidence the priest was sexually abusing their wives and daughters. Moturi further claimed the priest was harassing heads of institutions under the sponsorship of the church, who did not give in to his money demands. However, speaking to People Daily from Kebirigo Parish, where he has taken refuge, Fr Maticha dismissed claims that he was sexually assaulting his flock. He said he has served in the parish for more than 10 years and his record is well known, adding that those undermining his leadership are not “serious Christians”. Fr Jeremiah Nyakundi, the vicar general in charge of Kisii Diocese, said the matter was under investigation.
