Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin The government is targeting proceeds of counterfeit trade mainly property, in a renewed effort to nab perpetrators and curb  sale of fake products in the country. Anti-Counterfeit Authority (ACA), now an authority, yesterday said it is closing in on individuals who have benefited from proceeds of counterfeit businesses, in a move that will see palatial homes, high end vehicles, land and other investments recovered. Though the authority has not revealed names of the targets, a source familiar with the magnitude of counterfeit business told People Daily that top businessmen, politicians and high-net-worth individuals are among the biggest perpetrators who could cross swords with the authority. ACA is moving with haste on the back of the Anti-Counterfeit (Miscellaneous amendment  Act) 2018  which came into place in December last year. The Act gives the authority more power with backing from other government agencies in the anti-counterfeit war. Proceeds of counterfeit are linked to funding of terrorism and organised crime globally, a trend that has put the government on high alert as it continues to remain committed to the fight against terrorism. Executive director Elema Halake said ACA is working closely with Assets Recovery Agency and Directorate of Criminal Investigations to nab culprits. “We are going big on this. Apart from other measures being put in place to fight counterfeits, we are going after what someone has gained as a result of trade in counterfeits,” he told People Daily on the sidelines of a media sensitisation forum in Nairobi yesterday. The latest developments come amid a heightened war against counterfeits and illicit trade in the country where the government has made inroads through a multi-agency task force commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in April last year.
