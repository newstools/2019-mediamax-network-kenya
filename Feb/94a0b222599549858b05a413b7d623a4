Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Judiciary yesterday disclosed that the Sh310 million  house in Runda estate bought in 2013 as the official residence for the Chief Justice is yet to be occupied five years later. Chief Registrar Anne Amadi told a parliamentary committee that the house has been lying idle because there was a case filed in court after the Judiciary terminated the initial tenancy agreement. Amadi told the MPs in the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) chaired by William Cheptumo that they are in the process of refurbishing the house after the case was withdrawn from the courts. Procurement scandal The Judiciary purchased the house from Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama and paid for it in April 2013, but a scandal over procurement procedures got in the way before it was occupied. “Currently, the house is not in a habitable condition. Initially it was a subject of investigations but because we are done we want to refurbishment the house,” she said. Amadi who had appeared before the committee to defend the Judiciary’s budget regretted that the determination of corruption cases as well as completion of stalled projects in various parts of the country will be affected if the National Treasury fails to give them additional funding totaling to Sh5.2 billion. Of the Sh5.2 billion include Sh2 billion for recurrent expenditure and Sh3.2 billion for development projects that Judiciary plans to undertake as currently they have only been given a ceiling of Sh 3.8 billion.
