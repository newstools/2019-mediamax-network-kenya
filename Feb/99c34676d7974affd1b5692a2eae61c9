Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi National Land Commission  (NLC) chair Muhammad Swazuri has been barred from accessing his office.  Nairobi anti-corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti issued the temporary orders following an application by Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji, alleging Swazuri is interfering with the witnesses in his land compensation fraud charges. The DPP further  wants the bond and bail terms granted to Swazuri in a case where he is facing corruption-related charges cancelled. In an affidavit, prosecution counsel Esther Njuguna argues that Swazuri has been interfering with witnesses against express order of the court. “He has rendered the operations of NLC impossible and has virtually arrogated himself the role of the commission without due regard to the other commissioners,” stated Njuguna in court documents. According to DPP, Swazuri’s continued access to the commission’s office has virtually paralysed the commission’s operations as he has engaged in conduct that openly displays disregard for the rule of law and conducts business of the commission. Swazuri was charged last year alongside 13 others over fraudulent compensation of five parcels of the Standard Gauge Railway land. Meanwhile, in another court, Swazuri lost a bid to chair his last NLC meeting before term expires next week. Justice Hedwig Ong’udi ruled that Swazuri knew his term would end and that the court cannot meddle into affairs of the commission.  •
