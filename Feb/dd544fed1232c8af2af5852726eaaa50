Steve Umidha @steveumidha New motor vehicle dealers have recorded a drop in January’s sales raising the possibility that recent government directive to freeze new development projects and slow production of number plates is taking toll on the auto industry. The latest data by Kenya Motor Industry Association, shows a dip in the number of new vehicles sold locally in the first month of the year at 835 vehicle units compared to 936 sold in January last year with commercial vehicle class largely affected. “I think this can be explained by the fact that the government stopped development projects which normally affect sales of commercial vehicles that heavily rely on infrastructure projects by the government,” said Stephen Mbuthi, a motor industry expert “Other than that I cannot see any major reason.” Isuzu East Africa, a major assembler of commercial vehicles sold a paltry 259 units in January compared to 278 it sold in the same period last year, an indication that orders for such class of vehicles by the government has slackened. Most dealers bank on government orders to shore up sales. But Simba Corporation executive director Dinesh Kotecha says the industry should not worry, arguing that it was too early in the year and that the situation would improve in the coming months. He, however, blames the slight dip to recently delay in the production of car number plates by the National Transport and Safety Authority which had blamed lack of raw materials for the cause of delay that had affected thousands of cars at the port of Mombasa. “It is too early in the year to think the trend will sustain. the market will catch up from February and the year could be better than 2018 because government’s intervention to improve the sector,”  Kotecha told People Daily.
