Members of a Kenyan family being held in Dubai are seeking  government’s intervention to have their passports released after they were confiscated over Sh1.5 million rent arrears. Mwaura Muteria’s family has been trying to plead for leniency from Dubai authorities but their request has fallen on deaf ears. The family, that hails from Murang’a county, has been in Dubai for 11 years. Muteria told People Daily yesterday that trouble started in 2016 when an organisation he was working with as a project manager terminated his contract. He, however, stayed in Dubai with the hope of getting another job. Owing to financial challenges, the family defaulted on their rent in 2017 and checks issued to the landlord bouncedback. The landlord filed a criminal case against Muteria while he was in Kenya and upon his return, he was arrested.  “I pleaded guilty and prayed to be released against my passport so that I could look for a job and start paying the money owed to the landlord. However, I have not been fortunate to get a job in the last three years,” he said. However, in February, last year he got an offer letter with Oxfam International as a regional safety security advisor, but this was short-lived. But after several attempts, he last month received an offer letter in another organisation and is supposed to relocate to Yemen.  He is supposed to report to work this Friday but is worried that he might lose it again. “Though we had paid part of our rent in cash, the landlord told me that all legal fees and the returned cheques must be paid in full before he withdraws the case and travel ban on my name. They are claiming about Sh1.5 million (AED55,000). I have no ability to raise this amount and we are seeking assistance to offset the bill,” he added. Muteria said their residence visas are expiring this week, which means they might be forced to pay immigration overstay fines of up to Sh2,000 unless they exit the country within seven days.
