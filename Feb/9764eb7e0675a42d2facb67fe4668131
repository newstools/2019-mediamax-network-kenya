The Hague, Sunday Belgium has agreed to host Ivory Coast ex-president Laurent Gbagbo pending a possible appeal against his acquittal by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity. On January 15, the tribunal acquitted Gbagbo (pictured) and his aide, Charles Ble Goude, on charges stemming from a wave of violence after disputed elections in the west African nation in 2010. The following day, the court ruled there were no exceptional circumstances preventing the pair’s release from detention in The Hague, and said they could be sent to a member country willing to accept them. “In response to a request from the ICC, Belgium has agreed to take in Laurent Gbagbo,” foreign ministry spokesman Karl Lagatie said Saturday, citing the 73-year-old ex-leader’s “family ties” to the country. According to the Belgian press, one of Gbagbo’s wives, 47-year-old Nady Bamba, lives there. Prosecutors can still appeal the January 15 acquittal, but said in a statement Friday it was awaiting the court’s written judgment before deciding how to proceed. They have expressed fears that if freed, Gbagbo would not return to the court for a retrial if his acquittal is overturned on appeal. -Agencies
