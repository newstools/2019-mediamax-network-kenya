A 22-year-old man has been arraigned for attempting to sneak his 1-year-old daughter from Kenyatta National Hospital in a carrier bag in an effort to avoid paying a 56 thousand shillings hospital bill. Boniface Murage was arrested at the exit of  Kenyatta National Hospital after hospital guards demanded to frisk the  suspicious carrier bag he was holding dear.
