Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin The National Treasury has unveiled a Sh2.7 trillion budget for the 2019/20 financial year begining July 1, with education getting the largest allocation. This is up from the proposed Sh2.55 trillion spending plan for the  current financial year ending June 30 before it was revised upwards to Sh3.074 trillion. The Budget Policy Statement (BPS) tabled in Parliament yesterday, is tailored towards job creation and realisation of the Big Four Agenda projects. In the proposed budget, Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich has allocated Sh670.7 billion for development spend up from Sh631.2 billion while recurrent expenditure goes up 9.9 per cent to Sh1.66 trillion from the current year’s Sh1.513 trillion. National government will control Sh1.82 trillion of the budget, an increase from Sh1.75 trillion, with the Executive, Judiciary and Parliament allocated Sh1.76 trillion, Sh17.9 billion and Sh38.5 billion respectively. Consolidated Fund Services (CFS) under the national government, which holds money for operational costs – salaries and allowances, subscription to international organisations, payment of pensions and gratuities — gets Sh535.7 billion up from Sh490.6 billion. The education sector is the biggest winner if the budget is approved in its current state gets an allocation of Sh473.4 billion, seven per cent up from Sh442.3 billion. According to National Treasury CS Henry Rotich, the huge portion will go towards supporting the sector’s short term priorities which include recruitment of additional teachers to support government’s 100 per cent transition policy. Technical institutes The funds are also expected to support the free primary, secondary education, and special needs education through increased capitation as the segment takes up 26 per cent of the share in total ministerial expenditure. “The sector will also complete the ongoing construction and equipment of TTIs(Technical Training Institutes) and support university education in public and private universities in order to equip the youth with relevant skills required to drive the industrialisation agenda,” Rotich notes in the BPS. The second biggest allocation goes to Energy, Infrastructure and ICT which takes up Sh406.7 billion. This, however, is a 2.9 per cent cut from the current year’s Sh418.8 billion allocation. The reduction comes after the completion of a number of key projects including roads, procurement of a new ferry for the Likoni (Mombasa) channel — MV Jambo — reduced spending on geothermal projects after major achievements. The government expects to reduce spending on new mega infrastructure projects as focus now shifts to the Big Four agenda with housing as a priority. Key port, oil and gas, and ICT projects including the Konza Complex are however expected to continue. Public administration and international relations has been given Sh270.9 billion, governance, justice, law and order sector(Sh204.8 billion), national security(Sh153.6 billion), health (Sh96 billion),Environment (Sh82.3 billion), agriculture, rural and urban development (Sh59.1 billion), social protection Sh54.8 billion and general economic affairs Sh23.9 billion. Total revenue To support budget funding, Kenya Revenue Authority is expected to collect Sh1.88 trillion up from the current revised target of Sh1.65 trillion, with total revenues including Appropriation-in-Aid projected to increase to Sh2.08 trillion from Sh1.83 trillion. The planned higher spend comes amid cries of a swelling national debt which has seen concerns from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Treasury has been negotiating for roll-overs among other arrangements as it moves to meet its obligations. Reflecting the projected expenditure and revenue, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected at Sh629.9 billion. Overall fiscal deficit is projected at Sh578.3 billion. The government expects to borrow Sh306.5 billion externally and Sh277.5 billion in the domestic market and other net domestic receipts of Sh5.7 billion to bridge the deficit. Parliament should approve the BPS by February 28. Five quite progressive wart hogs towed aardvarks, although five angst-ridden dwarves. slightly. quickly tickled one progressive poison.
