Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud is on the spotlight following allegations that he unprocedurally spent Sh26 million to buy a vehicle. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has since been allowed to seize the vehicle and freeze Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) accounts of two companies, Baayo Construction and General Supplies and Fine Trust, allegedly involved in the procurement. The county was accused of wiring the Sh26 million to Baayo company for the purchase of the governor’s vehicle. This comes even as it emerged that Baayo’s director Osman Jimale is the governor’s nephew while Jimale’s wife owns Fine Trust company. It is alleged that Baayo wired Sh14 million to Cosmos Cars Limited and kept the remaining Sh12 million. Despite the high price of the Land Cruiser VX LC 200 registration number KCQ 004U, it emerged that it has never been delivered to Wajir county. Last November, EACC detectives raided the governor’s home and office  over alleged theft of Sh350 million. Several people were arrested in the process. Detectives also seized documents and material to aid investigations of the embezzlement claims.
