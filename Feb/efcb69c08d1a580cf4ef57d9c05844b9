Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe The family of Dandora human rights activist Caroline Mwatha, whose body was found at Nairobi’s City Mortuary, have insisted that the State introduced the abortion claims to cover up alleged murder. Mwatha’s father, Stanlus Mbai,  claimed her daughter was not pregnant as claimed by the government  pathologist and that an incision was made on her stomach and a foetus inserted. Speaking on Saturday during the funeral ceremony at Asembo, Rarieda constituency, Mbai said he was with Mwatha a week before her disappearance and she was not pregnant. The deceased’s husband Joshua Ochieng urged the State to ensure those behind her death are jailed. Mwatha was eulogised as a fearless human rights fighter. Siaya leaders, led by Senator James Orengo, asked the State to tame extrajudicial killings that are on the rise in the country. A recent statement from Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) claimed Mwatha may have died as a result of excessive bleeding caused by a botched abortion.
