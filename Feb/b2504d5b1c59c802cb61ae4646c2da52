Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Kabazi MCA Peter Mbae will spend yet another night in police custody after the prosecution sought more time to investigate Wednesday’s unrest in Solai where residents set a section of Patel farm on fire. Yesterday, investigating officer Dorcas Cherui—who is also the DCIO for Rongai—told Nakuru Resident Magistrate Yvonne Khatambi that they need at least 10 days to conclude investigations and ascertain the level of destruction caused. She said Mbae, who was arraigned alongside eight other suspects, had committed an act of incitement to violence, disobedience of the law and malicious destruction of property. “Investigators need ample time to interrogate the suspects,” she told the court. Ruling today Noting that tension is still high in the area, the officer pleaded with the court to allow them to move the suspects to Njoro Police Station—about 20km south-west of Nakuru town. He told the court the other eight accused persons were victims of last year’s dam tragedy where one of the dams in the vast Patel Coffee and Dairy Farm burst its walls, killing 49 people downstream. Khatambi ordered the accused remanded at Njoro until today when the ruling will be delivered.
