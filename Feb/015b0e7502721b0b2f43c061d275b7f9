Kinyuru Munuhe and Wangu Gacheche Deputy President William Ruto on Friday rallied Jubilee Party troops ahead of the much-anticipated Wajir West parliamentary by-election.While issuing a party certificate to immediate former area MP Ahmed Kolosh, who defected from Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) after nullification of his election, Ruto said the party would leave nothing to chance on April 25. The Supreme Court in January ordered for fresh elections in Wajir West in a petition that was filed by Abdirahman Ibrahim Mohammed (Kanu) challenging Kolosh’s win. The DP, who was accompanied Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju and National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale, said Jubilee would continue to focus its energies on unity and development across the country, urging other political parties to join the government in bringing Kenyans together irrespective of tribal and political persuasions. “Jubilee is going to field a candidate for the second time after we fielded another last year and won. In all probability we will spare nothing and for all practical intents and purposes
Wajir is a Jubilee county,” said Ruto. However, he called for sober political engagement by all contestants guided by policies, ideas and manifestos. “We want to encourage our competitors to organise themselves. We want a peaceful election that is decent and devoid of name-calling. We want to compete on the platform of issues and manifestos,” he added. Kolosh defected from ODM after he lost his seat through petitions. His election had been nullified by the High Court before he filed a case at the Court of Appeal. The appellate court upheld his election prompting his rival to seek redress at the Supreme Court where the election was annulled. The court established some of the votes cast in some polling stations exceeded the number of registered voters. Kolosh urged Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to conduct a free and fair by-election.
