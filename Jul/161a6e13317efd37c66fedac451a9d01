Alvin Mwangi and Bernice Mbugua @PeopleDailyKe Betting firms are this morning scheduled to meet officials from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to discuss the controversy surrounding tax remittance. At the same time, Nanovas International (K) Limited trading as betPawa has moved to court to seek orders to suspend a decision by Betting Control and Licensing Board to cancel its operating licence. Association of Betting Operators chairman Ronald Karauri, who is also SportPesa chief executive said they have engaged KRA in dialogue over the issue to iron out the differences. Expect consensus “A meeting has been arranged for this morning to discuss the issue. So far, I can say the progress has been positive and we  expect to reach a consensus soon,” he said. In court yesterday, betPawa, which is among the betting firms whose licences were cancelled by the government for failing to renew operational permits, wants the court to allow them to continue utilising its pay bill numbers and short codes without any interference by the betting board. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, the court be pleased to issue a conservatory order temporarily suspending the respondent’s decisions not to renew the petitioner’s bookmaker’s and public gaming licenses for the year 2019/2020 and allowing the petitioner to continue carrying on the bookmaking and public gaming business without any interference,” said the company in court documents. Through lawyer Emmanuel Wetang’ula, the betting firm argues that the betting board’s action was carried out without prior notification, involvement or their participation yet they stood to be directly and adversely affected by it.
