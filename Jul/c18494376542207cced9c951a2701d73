Kenya has heavily invested in geothermal energy as it targets 100 per cent transition to green energy by 2020. However, inadequate skilled manpower in geothermal science and technology remains a key challenge to achieving the objective. It is against this background that the Geothermal Development Company (GDC) opted to train 20 geologists from four African countries on collection of geosciences data in a bid to unlock the continent’s unexploited green energy and natural resources valued at billions of shillings. The Geothermal Leapfrog Software training, held at the Geothermal Centre of Excellence in Naivasha, attracted participants from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. GDC chief executive Johnson ole Nchoe (pictured) said the training focused on strengthening the mechanism for gathering, disseminating and archiving critical geological data required by investors and policy makers. Manpower challenge Access to geoscience data, he said, is essential for scientific investigation, managing geological hazards, land use evaluation, civil engineering projects, formulating State resource policy and efficient exploitation of natural resources sources. “With credible data, it is much easier to establish the amount of natural resources under Kenya’s and Africa’s feet. This reduces exploration risks and increases discovery rates of natural resources,” said Nchoe. Most African countries are committed to explore and develop geothermal energy in the wake of climate change.  -KNA
