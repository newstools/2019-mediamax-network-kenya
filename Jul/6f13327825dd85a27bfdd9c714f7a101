More than $2 billion (Sh205 billion) has been injected in Tatu City, a 5,000-acre, mixed-use development, in terms of factories, houses, schools and other forms of infrastructure. Tito Oduk, the commercial sales manager for Tatu City said the project is no longer a concept but reality of a city that has already taken off. He said schools and businesses are already open, and a range of houses are under construction to suit all incomes. “The city represents a new way of living and thinking for all Kenyans, creating a unique live, work and play environment that is free from traffic congestion and long-distance commuting,” he added during Koroga, an entertainment festival, held at the City. Oduk said in the course of being entertained, the company took the opportunity to take over 20,000 revellers who attended the two-day event around the City to showcase the progress of the project.
