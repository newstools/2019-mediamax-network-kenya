Suspended High Court judge Martin Muya yesterday resisted an attempt by the Judicial Service Commission to have his constitutional petition transferred to the Employment and Labour Relations Court. Justice Muya, through lawyer Philip Nyachoti, argued that only the High Court enjoyed exclusive power to interpret the Constitution, unearth violation of fundamental rights and freedoms and grant redress to aggrieved parties. Nyachoti said the preliminary objection raised by the JSC was incompetent since the suspended judicial officer’s major complaint was that he was not afforded an opportunity by the commission before it made a recommendation to President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 18 to appoint a tribunal to investigate his alleged misconduct for delaying judgements in two commercial disputes. The recommendation was made “in a highly biased, suspicious and questionable manner,” he said. Constitutional process “The investigation, suspension and removal of a judge is a constitutional process which cannot be considered a dispute between an employer and employee. The High Court is the only available forum for Justice Muya to seek redress for violations of his constitutional rights,” the lawyer submitted before Justice Weldon Korir. He said the President, through formal notices in the Kenya Gazette, suspended the judge on half pay and appointed a tribunal to investigate allegations of misconduct against him. The Head of State was not acting in his capacity as the judge’s employer, he said. Justice Muya is seeking to block proceedings of the seven-member tribunal, chaired by Appellate judge Alnashir Visram, which was sworn in on Wednesday at the Supreme Court Building in Nairobi. Justice Korir reserved the ruling on the preliminary objection until July 18. The complaints against Justice Muya were first investigated by a JSC committee chaired by Olive Mugenda. The other members were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, Emily Ominde and Patrick Gichohi.
