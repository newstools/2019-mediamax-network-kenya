Efforts to eradicate polio in the country are on course, the Rotary International has said. The global organisation, a spearheading partner of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said major strides have been made in the fight against the infectious disease. New Naivasha Rotary president Billy Mungai, said joint efforts between the organisation and the government are bearing fruit. The government has been having polio immunisation campaigns targeting children  following outbreaks in various parts of the country. Mobility equipment Speaking in Naivasha after his installation, Mungai said: “We are committed to working with the State and other partners to ensure polio is fully eradicated though immunisation.” He said they were working with their colleagues from Arizona in the US to provide mobility equipment to tens of people who had been disabled by polio. “In the past, Rotary has assisted those handicapped through the provision of mobility equipment and this will continue, mainly targeting those poor families in the rural areas,” he said. Mungai said the organisation was keen on improving water and sanitation provision, child-mother maternal health, education and economic empowerment. “We have several projects where we are drilling boreholes in various parts of Naivasha so that we can assist the less fortunate members of the society,” he said.
