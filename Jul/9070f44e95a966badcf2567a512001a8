Former Kenya Transport Association chief executive Alfayo Otuke said the move is positive as it will offer positive business competition in the country and at the same time go a long way in creating more opportunities for the country’s transport sector. “We see myriads of opportunities coming our way especially in the transport sector. The South Sudanese are going to bring businesses to our doorsteps,” he said.

In an interview with Business Hub, Otuke said that currently Kenya is facing stiff competition from the central corridor which connects the Port of Dar es Salaam and inland waterways to Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Eastern Parts of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), saying Kenya risks losing out to Tanzania. He said already Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda have started shifting focus to the central corridor and warned that Kenya should act fast to remain relevant in the transport business game. Following President Kenyatta’s announcement, South Sudan becomes the second country after the Kenyan government announced that it will give land to Uganda for construction of the dry port in Naivasha. Uganda is the biggest market for Kenyan goods and the biggest client to the Port of Mombasa, especially for transit cargo, ahead of DRC, South Sudan and Rwanda. Uhuru said South Sudan will be allocated 10 acres at the Naivasha Industrial Park to ease the movement of goods. The agreement announced at Statehouse on Monday will see South Sudan reduce the journey that it makes to Mombasa to collect and clear goods destined to Juba.
