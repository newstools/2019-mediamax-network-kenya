At least 4,000 civilian firearm holders risk prosecution if police make real threats to arrest and arraign Kenyans, who defied an order to undergo a mandatory fresh vetting process. Addressing the press yesterday in Kakamega, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai said 4,400 firearms holders did not show up for the mandatory vetting exercise despite the July 7  extension deadline issued by Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i. “The amnesty for all gun holders to surrender the firearms to authorities expired on June 30 but there was a seven-day extension. We shall now go for those who have not surrendered them,” he said. Enjoy power Firearms Licensing Board began the vetting exercise for civilian gun holders in February. Holders were to present all certificates, firearms and ammunition for verification and ballistics analysis. Mutyambai, who was on the second day of his work tour in Western region, said he was satisfied with the progress made on clearing unnecessary roadblocks on major highways in Kakamega. The IG denied media reports that removal of road blocks on the highways would give criminals space to operate and torment other road users. “I did not order removal of all roadblocks but unnecessary roadblocks and checks,” he said. Mutyambai said regional police commanders enjoy delegated power, hence can erect roadblocks anywhere when need be.
