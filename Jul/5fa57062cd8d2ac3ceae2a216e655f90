Deputy President William Ruto  yesterday accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of being a stumbling block to projects initiated  by the government. Ruto claimed Raila was using corruption claims to undermine various projects but said the move would not stop the government from achieving its Big Four agenda. He said Raila had opposed the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway, modernisation of the Kenya Ports Authority and the Northern Water Collector  Tunnel. “He is  now opposing funds drive for churches, women, youths and boda boda riders. His main agenda is to oppose everything that is good for the common man,” said Ruto. But in a quick rejoinder through ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna, Raila challenged Ruto to come clean on some of the projects that had been earmarked in Rift Valley but never took off due to corruption.
