Meru county statistics officer Alinoor Hussein has urged all staff conducting this year’s population census to discharge their mandate professionally. He called for due diligence in the exercise to enable the government to deliver credible population data. Hussein spoke during a meeting held at Imenti North sub-county and chaired by  area deputy county commissioner Isaac Masinde, to shortlist ICT supervisors from 11 sub-counties. The statistics officer asked county committee members spearheading the process to shun vested interests during shortlisting and final recruitment of census staff. He said all sub-county committees were in place and ready to carry out shortlisting and recruitment of required personnel as per the guidelines and schedule forwarded to them from the national and county teams. Stakeholders agreed that affirmative action concept should be upheld while shortlisting personnel. Educate public Hussein said community and opinion leaders have an obligation to educate the public on the difference between national population and development census and the National Integrated Identification Management System (Niims) registration, concluded in May this year. “The two have no similarity or connection for they serve a different purpose in helping the government improve on service delivery to the people,” he said He said sub-county committees have the powers to consult and deliberate on emerging issues based on the uniqueness of their areas, without having to depend on the county committee for definite guidelines. Census will be conducted from the night of  August 24/25 to August 31.                           -KNA
