Kenya Power has said the number of consumers connected to electricity stands at 7.1 million, a 30 per cent increase from last year. In new data released by the company, 440,000 power consumers were connected to the national power grid in the said period. Kenya Power’s acting chief executive Jared Othieno said the firm was committed to increasing their customers by 600,000 every year. Addressing the press in Naivasha during a four-day retreat for the firm’s senior managers, he said they were working to meet the government’s envisaged universal electricity connection by 2020. “The government has rolled out measures to ensure all parts of the country are connected to electricity and currently we have 7.1 million people connected to the national grid,” he said. Othieno said electricity demand during the peak season stood at 1,882mw, hence the need to increase production. Delays sorted The official said the firm has recently had challenges with the token system, but the issue has been addressed after harmonising of tariffs, which had seen customers placed in two groups depending on their electricity consumption. “The issue of delays has also been sorted by our service delivery partner, Safaricom,” he said.  The company’s acting general manager Thagichu Kiiru said fuel cost, foreign exchange and VAT rates determine the cost of electricity every month.
