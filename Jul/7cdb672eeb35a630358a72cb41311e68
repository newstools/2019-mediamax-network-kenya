Victor Omondi @PeopleSports11 Kisumu Day will represent Nyanza region in boys’ football during the National Secondary Schools Games the county is set to host in two weeks’ time. This is after Barding High School were disqualified on Tuesday, having been found guilty of fielding an ineligible player in the Nyanza region final which they won 2-0 two weeks ago. After the regional final, Kisumu Day coach  Booker Odhiambo complained that his opponents had fielded an overage player, claiming he had evidence that Aton Okoth Oyugi used falsified documents to feature in the games.Odhiambo subsequently filed an appeal, saying Oyugi was born on October 10, 1997, meaning he is above 19, which is contrary to Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association rules. Kisumu Day’s appeal was successful as after going through the documents presented to them, Kisumu County Director of Education Isaac Atebe said Barding’s victory had been annulled after confirming the illegality. Found guilty “Following your appeal alleging that Barding High School Boys falsified details and documents on Oyugi, the office wishes to inform you that the investigations carried out confirms the allegations,” read part of the appeals committee’s letter to Kisumu Day. The letter continued: “Barding High School has therefore been annulled and Kisumu Day continues to represent Nyanza region in the nationals.” Odhiambo welcomed the decision, saying: “We are happy because justice has been served and we are ready for a face-off with other teams in the nationals.” There has been no love lost between the two sides in the recent past especially after Barding upset the apple cart by winning the national title in 2016, relegating past giants Kisumu Day to the periphery. Cases of age cheating have also been rife in school games over the years and the same scenario could be witnessed in Western region where Kibabii Boys, Bunyala and St Peter’s Mumias are facing anxious waits after appeals were filed against them.
