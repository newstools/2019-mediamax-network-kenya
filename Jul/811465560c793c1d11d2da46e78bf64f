Lewis Njoka @LewisNjoka Safaricom Board of Directors was aware of Bob Collymore’s deteriorating health and had made adequate plans to ensure the company’s activities will not be adversely affected in case he was incapacitated, Safaricom chairman Nicholas Ng’ang’a said yesterday. “We do not expect any sudden loss of direction. The board will meet today to discuss how best to strengthen the company’s leadership,” said Ng’ang’a. “The company is in good hands and will continue to offer all the services it has been offering before Bob’s death,” he added. The death of Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore is expected to renew succession efforts at the giant telco that came to the fore this May when the board extended his term for one year. In April, Reuters reported that a row had erupted at the company over Collymore’s succession with the government, a major shareholder, insisting that the next CEO had to be a local, a factor that had delayed the announcement of his replacement. All previous CEOs Michael Joseph and Collymore were seen as representing the interests of Vodafone, which was until 2017 the largest shareholder in the company. In 2017, Vodafone conducted a share swap with Vodacom of South Africa which left it with only five per cent shareholding. Vodacom now owns 35 per cent of Safaricom, equal to the government’s shareholding. However, the extension of Collymore’s term was interpreted by analysts to mean that the company’s board of directors preferred continuity over change. During his medical leave, Safaricom chief financial officer Sateeshi Kamath acted at as the CEO assisted by Joseph Ogutu, the company’s director of strategy and innovation. Nga’ng’a described Collymore as a visionary leader whose zest to build a purpose led organisation greatly benefitted the giant telco. tickets.
