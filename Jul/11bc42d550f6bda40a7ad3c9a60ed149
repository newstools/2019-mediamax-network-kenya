George Kebaso @Morarak Opposition leader Raila Odinga yesterday called on Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja and the County Assembly to amicably resolve their differences over the budget instead of opting to go to the ballot. Raila, however, proposed dissolution of the County Government should the parties fail to reach an agreement, saying this would serve as a lesson to other counties with similar problems. “I have discussed with the governor and I have asked for some understanding and caution. Yes, I know that the governor and his team wanted to go back to the debe (ballot), but, if there is no solution, then there is no any other way; take it to the voters who have the power to say yes or no. But before we reach that stage, let the MCAs sit down with the governor and his leadership under the guidance of the Senate,” Raila said at his Capitol Hill office yesterday. He named Homa Bay, Kisumu, Nairobi, and Mombasa as the other counties that have similar problems. Samboja, however, said collection of signatures will still continue as he feels the leaders are not ready for such a dialogue. “We turned to Raila because he has been a champion of devolution and understands it well. He has advised us and we have listened to him carefully, but we have told him as much as there is push for dialogue, you can only do it when all the parties are honest, not when one of them has a card under the table,” said the governor.
