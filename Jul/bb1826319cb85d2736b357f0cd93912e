Cairo, Monday @PeopleSports11 Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez scored for Algeria as they coasted into the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals with a 3-0 victory over Guinea in Cairo on Sunday. Youcef Belaili put the Desert Foxes ahead on 24 minutes and former African Footballer of the Year Mahrez added a second after 57 minutes in the last-16 match at the 30 June Stadium. Substitute Adam Ounas was on the field only five minutes when he completed the rout with eight remaining, connecting with a low cross to give goalkeeper Ibrahim Kone no chance. “I think we had a very solid match against a good team from Guinea. We did not concede a goal and scored three,” said Mahrez. “It was a very good night for us and we are happy that we won against a team that were not easy to manoeuvre.” With hosts Egypt and Herve Renard-coached Morocco suffering stunning last-16 losses, many are tipping Algeria to go all the way and add to their lone title, won in 1990. They are only nation among the 10 survivors boasting a 100 percent record having beaten Kenya, highly-rated Senegal and Tanzania in group matches to reach the knockout phase. Algeria will face the Ivory Coast or Mali in a quarter-final in Suez Thursday then, if successful, Nigeria or South Africa for a place in the July 19 final. Coach Djamel Belmadi changed nine of the team that outclassed Tanzania in the final group game, restoring a host of first choices such as Mahrez. Guinea, meanwhile, were missing Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita after he was forced to leave Egypt after a recurrence of a groin injury sustained against Barcelona in May. The referee was kept busy during physical early exchanges, booking Guinean Mady Camara and Algerian Adlene Guedioura within 14 minutes of the kick-off. Camara was punished for a blatant foul on Mahrez, but Guedioura fired wide from the resultant free-kick close to the box.    -AFP
