Oliver Musembi and Clement Kamau @PeopleDailyKe A new team perceived to be opposed to Governor Ferdinand Waititu took over leadership of the Kiambu County Assembly during House elections yesterday. The highly contested positions included that of the Leader of Majority of the Jubilee Party, the Chief Whip and their deputies, which were captured by newcomers. The new Leader of Majority is Gideon Gachara  of Ndeiya Ward. He replaced Anthony Ikonya, who was impeached by members on July 1. The party’s new Chief Whip is Theta Ward MCA Simon Karema, who took over from James Mburu (Mwiki Ward) who resigned recently. Speaking after the elections presided over by Jubilee party official Franklin Mwendani, Gachara (pictured) and Karema said they will work to restore the independence of the County Assembly and redeem its image in the public. “The former leadership was seen to be a mouthpiece of the county executive and its oversight role was put to question by Kiambu voters,” Gachara said and added that his team will take corrupt county officials head-on. Regain confidence “Kiambu which is the home of President Uhuru Kenyatta has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. We shall work to regain the confidence of ‘Wanjiku’(voters) and the public in general,” said Gachara. Karema said although majority of the Assembly members were not happy with the previous leadership, the new team is not at war with Governor Waititu.  Also newly elected were deputy majority leader Anne Wanjiku Kariuki who narrowly beat her sole opponent Jane Gathiga by garnering 43 votes against 42.
