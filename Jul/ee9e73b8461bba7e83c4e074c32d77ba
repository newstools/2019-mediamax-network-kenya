Kenya National Shipping Line (KNSL) is facing fresh obstacles in its bid to operate the Sh27 billion-second container terminal in Mombasa. Dock workers and a Mombasa-based lobby group have threatened to move to court after National Assembly failed to stop a memorandum by President Uhuru Kenyatta rejecting a bid to lock a Swiss-based firm, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) out of the shipping line. Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) and Dock Workers Union (DWU) which have been spearheading campaigns to reject amendment of section 16 of the Merchant Shipping Act 2019, said they are still opposed to plans to privatise the port facility. Muhuri Chairman Khelef Khalifa said the NGO’s lawyers led by Senior Counsel John Khaminiwa have started the process of drafting the petition for filing in court. The rejected bill sought to amend section 16 of the Merchant Shipping Act to give Transport Minister powers to allow a shipping line to operate a terminal. President Uhuru, however, referred back the bill to the House for consideration. The development comes at a time envoys from four states have also rejected plans to privatise the second container terminal through single sourcing. Denmark UK, France and Japan particularly opposed the inclusion of MSC which owns 33 per cent of stake in KNSL, saying this will give the shipping line advantage over other operators. Dock Workers Union Secretary General Simon Sang said that the passing of recommendations by the President paves way for “privatisation of the port through back door”.
