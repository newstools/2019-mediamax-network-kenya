Kinyuru Munuhe and Lydiah Nyanchwa @PeopleDailyKe Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja was yesterday questioned at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters in Nairobi  in relation to feuds pitting farmers against herders. Besides the governor, other local leaders grilled were Senator Jones Mwaruma, Mwatate MP  Andrew Mwadime, Women Rep Lydia Haika and six Members of County Assembly. Taita Taveta County Assembly Leader of Majority Jason Tuja also recorded a statement. When he emerged from the daylong session, Samboja said he had responded to summons to answer questions relating to insecurity in the county. Preach peace “I received summons, which  were extended to my senator. He and the Mwatate MP have finished recording statements. I am also aware the Women Rep and a number of MCAs were summoned,” he said . He urged area leaders to preach peace and coexistence among communities. “The issue is very simple. It has everything to do with the camels and the security in the county. As the leadership, it is our responsibility to maintain law and order. I was asked a number of questions and I have given the answers. We now leave it to the investigative agencies to do the investigations,” said Samboja. Local farmers are embroiled in conflicts with camel herders whom they accuse of invading their farms and destroying crops. Early last month, a 35-year-old farmer was killed in Sagalla area by herders.  And in retaliation, 20 camels were killed in Kirumbi village. Those found culpable risk facing incitement to violence charges after the DCI submits the investigation files to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for review. Samboja’s administration suspended the issuance of lease agreements by local ranchers to herders from outside the county until investigations into how the documents were issued to them are complete. Private landowners were barred from entering into agreements with herders.
