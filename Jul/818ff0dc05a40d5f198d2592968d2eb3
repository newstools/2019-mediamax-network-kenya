PD Correspondent @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has urged the youth to shun drugs and encouraged those who are already hooked to seek help. Speaking when he paid a visit to former boxing heroine Conjestina Achieng, who is recovering at Eden House Rehabilitation Centre, Diani, Sonko said there were rehabilitation centres across the country where addicts can get help. “We have to ensure our youth are involved in productive activities,” Sonko told journalists at the centre. The governor hailed the progress Conjestina had made and said her recovery would serve as an inspiration to many youth who are battling drug addiction. Last year, Conjestina was airlifted by Sonko from her Kisumu home for the rehabilitation, after her sorry state was highlighted by the media. Yesterday, she thanked Sonko and his support for her health. “I will always appreciate what the governor has been doing for me and many other people in need of help,” she said. Conjestina dismissed speculation that she had escaped the rehab.  “A lot has been said about me but it is not all true,” she said.
