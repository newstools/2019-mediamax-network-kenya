LEWIS NJOKA Bob Collymore was a shrewd corporate player well versed in private sector-government relations. Under his leadership, Safaricom continued its dominance of the Kenyan telecommunications market posting billions of shillings in profit for the last eight successive years. Collymore’s business acumen became apparent immediately he took over in 2010 from the way he steered the company through price wars initiated by its main rival, Airtel. At the time, Safaricom chose to maintain its tariffs higher than competition, a decision many thought would affect its profitability. Collymore’s corporate success strategy was guided by three pillars, focusing on customer, developing products that meet client needs and the pursuit of operational excellence through constant innovation. He was also highly influential in government circles. Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta picked him as a member of the Vision 2030 delivery board. He also appointed him to the National Cancer Institute board. It is widely believed that the appointment of Nzioka Waita to become President Kenyatta’s chief of staff and head of the Presidential Delivery Unit had Bob’s blessings and served to cement Safaricom’s influence within the government circles. Before joining government, Waita was Safaricom’s Head of Corporate Affairs. Through lobbying and enlisting the help of his networks in government, he recently fought off attempts by the Communications Authority to break the company into two, the financial services business and the telecoms business, in an attempt to address its dominance.
