Head coach Sebastien Migne was missing as Harambee Stars players returned to the country to a low key reception yesterday morning after their exit from the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) on Tuesday. Kenya, who were eliminated after losing two group matches to Senegal and Algeria and winning one against Tanzania, took stock of what has been a painful learning exercise which exposed the gulf in class between them and the best in the continent. Most of the players, led by captain Victor Wanyama and striker Michael Olunga, opted not to speak to the media with only deputy skipper Musa Mohammed, striker Masud Juma and goalkeeper Patrick Matasi granting journalists interviews. Matasi, who earned praise for making numerous saves against Senegal including, a penalty, said Kenya has learned great lessons in Egypt which they hope to carry forward especially in the 2020 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN), 2012 Afcon and 2022 World Cup qualifiers. ‘“I performed to best to my ability and saving Sadio Mane’s penalty has given me more confidence despite us not making it past the group stages. The team is full of young players who will pull up their socks if given time,” said Matasi. Mohammed said: “We cracked in the last minutes against Senegal and simple mistakes cost us a place in the last 16. On behalf of the team, apologise to the country, the fans and government who gave us moral and financial support.’’ In the absence of Migne, his assistant Francis Kimanzi, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) boss Nick Mwendwa, his deputy Doris Petra and CEO Robert Muthomi led the squad back home. “I think there were some positives like the win against Tanzania. The losses to Senegal and Algeria exposed what we need to work on and there is room for improvement before we kick start our preparations for 2021 Afcon and 2022 World Cup qualifiers,” said Mwendwa. For striker Juma, who did not get a chance to play, watching from the bench still taught him a lot to take into the future.
