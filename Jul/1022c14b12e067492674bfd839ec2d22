Kenya Forest Service has licensed more than 700 acres of Mount Kenya Forest for habitation of endangered mountain bongo species. Speaking during the launch of the National Recovery and Action Plan for the mountain bongo, a striped antelope, KFS director general Julius Kamau said the agency would issue a special use licence to allow the fencing of  the protected area in Ontulili Forest. “The board has favourably considered the request by Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy to give a special use licence for mountain bongo and I have signed the communiqué granting them authority of the protected area,” said Kamau. The area will be used for the release of mountain bongos, which have been undergoing a breeding programme in captivity, back to the wild. Mountain bongo has been classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a critically endangered species, with Kenya hosting 77 of the total 96 population in the world. Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, who attended the event, said the conservation plan would see the rare antelope population grow to 730 in the next 50 years.
