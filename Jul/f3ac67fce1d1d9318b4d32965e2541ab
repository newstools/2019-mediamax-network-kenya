Real estate firm Heri Homes is joining the government’s noble venture of investing in the future through affordable housing. The firm recently partnered with Singapore’s Afra Holdings Limited and their Kenyan subsidiary Singapura Developers to lead in developing Habitat Heights Estate. The deal will see the firm sell 2,000 of the 8,888 affordable housing units through their expertise with Saccos. Heri Homes CEO Kimotho Kimani said they will use their strategic position as marketing and business development experts, which have seen them hand over 800 units to homeowners in a span of three years. These homeowners are from Kenya as well in the diaspora especially in the US and UK. “We will target all these market segments to make Habitat a success even as we empower more Kenyans to lead fulfilling lives in their own homes,” he said. Afra Holdings director Sikukuu Mclanhan, Hariharan Karthikeyan, Heri Homes marketing director Paul Mugo and Afra Holdings PR and communications manager Daniel Othieno attended the agreement-signing event.
