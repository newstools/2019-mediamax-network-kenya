KAMPALA, Uganda on Sunday marked the annual National Day of Physical Activity in a renewed fight against increasing non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which account for 40 percent of deaths in the east African country. President Yoweri Museveni led a 10km walk which started and ended here at the Kololo Independence grounds. The activities included free screening for NCDs, yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccination, running, jogging, dancing, among others. The day was held under the theme, “My health, My responsibility,” and aims at raising awareness about the importance of physical activity, staying fit and healthy. Ministry of health says physical activity helps in fighting NCDs like heart disease, cancers, diabetes and hypertension, which cause premature deaths. (Xinhua)
