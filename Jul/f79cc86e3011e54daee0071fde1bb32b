Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on Monday arrested West Pokot county secretary and a senior procurement officer in connection with the irregular purchase of 20,000 bags of maize worth Sh18 million. The anti-corruption agency sleuths are also looking for two other senior county officials — ICT officer and supplies chain officer — who escaped during the arrest. EACC spokesperson Yassin Amaro said the suspects are being questioned and would be presented in court once investigations are complete. “They have been arrested in connection with irregular purchase maize estimated at Sh18 million,” he told People Daily in a phone interview. EACC investigators revealed that the maize was bought through single sourcing at an inflated price of Sh4,200 per bag. “This is in total disregard to procurement laws. In particular, the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015,” added Amaro. Under the Act, single sourcing or restricted tender is only applicable where the product or service has only one unique manufacturer or supplier. Abuse of office Reliable sources intimated to People Daily that the maize was acquired from farms owned by senior county officials including Governor John Lonyangapuo, who is associated with Zea Farm where the bulk of the crop was acquired. Sources at EACC said the governor is under investigations over abuse of office, corruption, flawed hiring of staff and unexplained wealth. Lonyangapuo said the arrests are malicious adding that the claims are politically motivated.
