The County Public Accounts and Investment Committee (CPAIC) had invited Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku to respond to audit queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko in his recent audit reports. The auditors failure to show up drew the anger of members of the committee. Senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii), Ledama ole Kina (Narok) and Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu), accused Governor Lenku of conspiring with the auditors not to turn up for the meeting. This was after the committee clerk Julius Ariwomoi alleged he had received a call from Kajiado county Secretary Lenku Sika, saying the auditors would not honour the invitation because they were unprepared. But the Governor (pictured) denied the accusation, saying he had nothing to do with the auditor’s absence. “I am not aware of the whereabouts of the auditors and if any of my officers has been mentioned to be involved I am not aware,”  he told the committee. Committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ (Homa Bay) said it would be untenable to continue with the session without the auditors and adjourned the meeting.
