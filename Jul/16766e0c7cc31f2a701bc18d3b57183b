Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has faulted leaders allied to the Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga teams for concentrating too much on politics while disregarding their duty to deliver their campaign pledges to the electorate. He said for a long time, leaders have been engaging in unnecessary 2022 succession politics adding that for the sake of national cohesion and development, leaders need to “get back to their senses” and work for the electorate. Speaking in Nakuru during a rally organized by Team Wanjiku, Kuria said the current political situation is unhealthy. “We cannot wake up day in day out to listen to politics.  This country does not belong to a few individuals and we are tired. Leaders should stop divisive politics and focus on uniting Kenyans,” said Kuria. Former Makadara MP Reuben Ndolo said Team Wanjiku is the voice  of the voiceless claiming that cartels have taken over the government and are trying to arm twist leaders who want to serve the electorate. “It’s a pity that the common mwananchi is being oppressed right, left and centre. We will deal with the cartels who are on a mission to destroy the country,” said Ndolo. Politician Stanley Livondo warned premature campaigns will affect realisation of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s  Big  Four agenda. Former Kibwezi legislator Kalembe Ndile took a swipe at the government  over proposal that requires boda boda riders to procure insurance cover for their passengers. Former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga said the government should assist the youth get jobs saying that most of them have lost hope.
