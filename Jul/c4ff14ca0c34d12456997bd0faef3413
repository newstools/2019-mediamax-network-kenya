The Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is still collecting views from Kenyans before it retreats to write a report. BBI chairman Yusuf Haji yesterday said: “We will complete our activities in October after which we will submit a report to President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.” His remarks come after a report purported to be from the taskforce, and recommending a constitution review to put in place a parliamentary system of government, was widely shared on social media. BBI has since dismissed the report as fake news, saying the team has not written any preliminary report in that regard. A parliamentary system of government involves having a president with limited powers and a powerful prime minister, who is the head of government.
