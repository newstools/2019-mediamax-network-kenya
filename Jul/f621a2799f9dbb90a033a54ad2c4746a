Zoo Kericho seeks to enlist services of five new players before the next season starts in a bid to bolster performance of the Kericho-based club in the country’s top-flight league. According to the club head coach Herman Iswekha, they intend to hire two defenders, a similar number of midfielders and one striker in a move aimed at filling the gap left by players who have since moved to other clubs. “We are narrowing in on five players and we hope to recruit them before the season starts,” said Iswekha who is the tactician of the SportPesa Premier League side on phone yesterday. He, however, did not give names of the players on the club’s raddar promising to do so when the club resumes trainings tomorrow. But he disclosed that goalkeeper   Vincent Misikhu has since rejoined the club from Wazito. He was Zoo’s goalkeeper before he left for Wazito. “We are resuming trainings on Thursday at the Kericho Green Stadium ahead of the start of the season. We will be able then to know who has accepted our terms and subsequently joining the club. So for now we wait till then,” he added. Key players who have since left the Kericho-based club include the recent one of Danson Chetambe to Bandari, striker Nicholas Kipkirui (Gor Mahia), Isaac Kipyegon (AFC Leopards) and Midfielder Michael Madoya (Tusker). Zoo survived relegation by a whisker at the end of last season. They finished the table standings in position 15 despite all the odds including  losing the key players to other clubs.
