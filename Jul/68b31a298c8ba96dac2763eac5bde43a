Murang’a County government will send a team of medical practitioners to Spain to undertake specialised training. Governor Mwangi wa Iria said his administration will sign a memorandum of understanding with the  Spanish government to facilitate the training for some of the local doctors in various fields. Wa Iria spoke on Tuesday during a free surgery camp by a group of doctors from Spain at Maragua Level 4 Hospital. For the last four years, the doctors have been visiting Maragua Hospital annually to offer free surgical services not only from the county but also from other parts of the country. “By December, we will send a group of nurses and doctors to a Spanish university to specialise in areas which have few medical specialists. On the field of surgery, we have few doctors and we need more to offer the needed services in our hospitals,” said  Wa Iria. He revealed the county intends to increase the number of theatres to 10 to save patients from travelling for long distances to get surgical services in the six theatres across the county.
