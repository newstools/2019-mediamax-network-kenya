Sergio Aguero has been making the most of the summer break with girlfriend Sofia Calzetti, and cruised around Miami this week in a stunning Manchester City-blue McLaren Spider. The iconic Premier League striker is Stateside enjoying what remains of his time off from football, before joining back up with his City team-mates for pre-season. Aguero and Calzetti, 22, were spotted shopping at the plush Miami mall Bal Harbor after arriving in the rare supercar. The pair strolled through the complex before stopping for a bite to eat at an outdoor restaurant. Calzetti, who works as a part-time model although she is studying to be an auctioneer, is thought to have met the City star at a birthday party organised in a Buenos Aires nightclub. Rumours they were dating first began to emerge at the start of April. The pair have recently been holidaying together in the exotic Paradise Islands in the Bahamas, along with Aguero’s young son from a previous relationship, Benjamin. While Aguero makes the most of what remains of his break, his City team-mates have been getting to work on the pitch. Pep Guardiola’s side opened up their pre-season campaign with a 4-1 victory over Premier League rivals West Ham in Nanjing, in the semi-final clash of the Asia trophy. A final showdown with Wolves however saw the reigning English champions taste defeat, losing 3-2 on penalties following a 0-0 stalemate in Shanghai.
