DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzanian Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Tuesday the east African nation will never allow itself to be used as a dumping ground for counterfeit products from abroad. Inaugurating the 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF), Hassan directed the Ministry of Industry and Trade to ensure that no counterfeit products were sold in the country. “This action by the government is intended to protect our local products to compete in the market,” she said in her speech broadcast live by state-owned Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. Hassan urged the Ministry of Industry and Trade to ensure that local industries improve the quality of products by using modern technology and Tanzanians will change their mindset when it comes to buying the products. She said once the local industries produced quality goods it will be simple for relevant authorities to find international markets for the products through the country’s embassies abroad. Hassan also urged relevant authorities to oversee the implementation of the blueprint regulatory reforms scheduled to take effect in 2019-2020 financial year in order to improve the business climate in the country. Philip Mpango, the Minister for Finance and Planning, told parliament in June that implementation of the blueprint was among priorities put forth by the government in executing the 2019/2020 budget. Mpango said industrial development and agricultural prosperity was among priorities as government is focusing on promoting investment and use of locally produced raw materials especially from the agricultural sector. Innocent Bashungwa, the Minister for Industry and Trade, said the number of foreign companies participating in the 43rd DITF has increased from 508 in 2018 to 580 this year.  (Xinhua)
