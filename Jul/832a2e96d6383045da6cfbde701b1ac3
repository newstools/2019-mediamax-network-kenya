Charles Thuku in Dar es Salaam @PeopleSports11 Kenya failed in its bid to win the Confederation of East and Central Africa Amputees Federation (CECAAF) championships after losing 3-1 to Rwanda in a tough final at National Stadium in Dar-es-Salaam on Sunday night. Hosts Tanzania finished runner-up after edging out sister nation Zanzibar 2-1. Cheered by several Kenyans who live and work in Tanzania, Harambee Stars amputees went behind in the 13th minute when Rwanda’s two-goal hero Paul Ntambara beat goalkeeper Tony Mundia at close range. Eugene Maganga equalised for Kenya in the 19th minute before the team went further behind by conceding goals from Fidel Gatete and Ntambara in the 23rd and 41st minute respectively. Despite the defeat, Kenya were composed in the game and many felt they exceeded expectations by winding up second especially given they had inadequate training ahead of the event. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who was the sponsor of Team Kenya, commended the players for a job well done. “By excelling in the championship, you did not do it for me but rather for the entire nation. Rest assured that I will always be with you whenever you are Kenya’s emissaries in Africa and world events,” said Sonko, who has previously supported the team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cups in Mexico. Kenya Amputee Football Federation (KENAFF) secretary Peter Oloo said: “This success is the fruits of hard work but I must say it would not have been possible without Sonko’s support and may God bless him.”
