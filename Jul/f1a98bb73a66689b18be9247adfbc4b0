Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Police in Nairobi are investigating an incident in which a woman reportedly killed her husband and her two children before committing suicide in Thome estate yesterday. Joyce Wanjiru, 32, stabbed her husband in the back and neck as he lay on the bed and strangled their three-year-old daughter whose body was found next to the father’s by a neighbour.  The son, five, was also strangled and his body found on the couch. Kasarani deputy OCPD Catherine Ringera said police believed the woman committed suicide by hanging herself using a rope inside their house after brutally killing the three. By yesterday evening, police had not traced any family member of the deceased. “The only information we have is that the husband, Joseph Gitau, hails from Njoro and that relatives of the wife stay in Kariobangi,” she said. The family of four lived in one-roomed mabati house in Thome 5 behind Homeland hotel. Temporary structure Sources said the plot owner had erected the temporary structure for the family and employed the deceased man as the caretaker. Though preliminary investigations pointed to murder and suicide, detectives said they would widen the scope of investigations. Police could not establish if the killings occurred on Monday night or yesterday morning.  Neighbours informed the police the family had been having frequent domestic quarrels.  The incident comes in the wake of worrying spate of spousal killings across the country.
