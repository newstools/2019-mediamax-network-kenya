Victor Omondi @PeopleSports11 Harambee Stars’ elimination from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations left a bitter taste in the mouths of most fans and many are still wondering if they will ever match the best on the continent. However, legend Ambrose Nyapada, who scored two goals as Kenya won the 1958 Gossage Cup after Uganda had claimed it for three successive years, wants fans to give the players time. “They really tried. In fact, people should cheer them when they return because playing against teams with international experience is not as easy as you may think,” said the 86-year-old, one of the two surviving members of the ‘Class of 58’, the other being Joe Kadenge. Even as he calls for patience, ‘Nyapash’, as his fans call him, is not happy with Stars’ tactics at Afcon. Watching a repeat of the final group game between Kenya and Senegal on Tuesday, Nyapada kept clicking, telling this writer: “I did not watch the match last night because I slept early but the boys are really letting me down. Look at how they are playing defensively instead of focusing on the target. This is where we go wrong.” The octogenarian, who lives in Moscow Estate in the outskirts of Kisumu town, played as a striker, having developed interest in football in 1941 while at Maranda Primary School in Siaya County and later Tambach Boys in Elgeyo-Marakwet County. His talent was fully discovered while at a Ugandan College in 1955 and he never looked back, his other team-mates being Peter Oronge (captain), Paul Owiti, Levy Ayadi, Minalo Opicho, Isaack Ligenyo, Ben Okoth, Elijah Lidonde and Suleiman Ngoloko, all deceased.
