Muoki Kiilu led bigwig Notorious to a strong finish at the highlight 2,800m Gooch Cup with his eight-and-a-half length gap destroying his challengers. The long distance meet was electric in all facets with the five runners bolting out strongly at Ngong Race Course on Sunday. In the middle of the race, the trio of Notorious, from Onesmus Mutuaâ€™s stable, Shaman and Winter Comet led the onslaught while exchanging positions in between. Strategies were witnessed in the final 1,600m as the fillies began picking spots in readiness for a shot at the finish line. However, Leslie Sercombe, atop Shaman, attacked from the inside lane with Paul Kiarie, jockeying Winter Comet, taking the wide lane going head-to-head as the sizable crowd roared on from the stands. An astute Kiilu bolted from the blue like thunder as he sauntered the South African breed past fellow runners to clinch the race after clocking 3.09.8. The contest was decided primarily on endurance and finishing prowess as the likes of Caen and Impala fell off the chase in the handicap reserved for three-year-olds. In the 1,600m Mickey Migdoll Trophy, veteran Josephat Kultiang raced to a tight victory atop Forewarned in a meet timed at 1.56.06 at close. The middle distance race was dominated by hard running with speedy fillies chasing each other especially from the final bend. Joseph Mutevu, riding Ione, and Muoki Kiilu, jockeying Bulawayo, were impeccable and aggressive but ultimately Kultiang stood out for his quick runs with only a length-and-a-quarter separating the top three runners of the day.
