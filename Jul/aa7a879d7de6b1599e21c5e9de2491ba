Eleven women arrested in Mombasa’s Nyali estate for allegedly engaging in live pornographic video streaming last week, were yesterday charged in Shanzu Law Courts with trafficking in obscene publication. Two other people, a man and woman alleged to be the owners of the porn webcam business, were charged with living on earnings of prostitution. Webcam business involves video streaming of content in which women or men showcase explicit sexual acts in exchange for pay. The 11 suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges when they appeared before Principal magistrate Florence Macharia. Exercise control The charges read that  on July 10 at Simba Estate, House Number 17, in Nyali sub-county, for the purpose of trade the accused conveyed obscene publication namely transmission of pornographic video to corrupt morals. They were released on a bond of Sh50,000 each with an alternative of Sh20,000 cash bail each. Enock Elisha Ochieng and Merceline Atieno Onyango, who allegedly run the webcam site, also pleaded not guilty to charges of earning from prostitution. The charges read that on the same date at the same house, knowingly and unlawfully, the two lived wholly on earnings of prostitution in that they exercised control, direction and influence over the movements of prostitutes for the purpose of gain. They were released on a Sh100,000 bond with an alternative of Sh50,000 cash bail after the magistrate said the  prosecution had not given any compelling reasons why the suspects should remain in custody. Internet access According to an online academic platform, The Conversation, a web cam business only requires a computer, a decent webcam, access to high speed internet connection and a webcam hosting site.  The matter will be heard on July 30.
