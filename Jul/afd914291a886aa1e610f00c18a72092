The former soldiers are seeking compensation for torture after they were captured and detained during the 1982 attempted coup during former President Moi’s era. Senate National Security Defence and Foreign Relations committee yesterday regretted the emotional and physical suffering they experienced when they were incarcerated and later dismissed from service. “The ministry should do anything to pay them. We cannot continue punishing these people any further,” the committee chair Senator Yusuf Haji (Garissa) said in a meeting with the Ministry of Defence officials yesterday. “They must be paid.” However, it is not the first time such a directive has been given but with no action. A similar case by former servicemen has been in the court for the last 30 years and recently the courts ruled in their favour but they have not been paid to date. The committee said the State can no longer afford to dilly dally in compensating the soldiers, who were unfairly detained for up to eight months at Kamiti and Naivasha maximum prisons. “The government has no option but to look for money and pay the ex-soldiers,” said Haji, who was a senior government officer at the time of the attempted coup. Committee members including Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula and his Kisumu counterpart Fred Outa accused Defence Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo and the entire ministry of endlessly frustrating the former soldiers and subjecting them to continuous misery. Responding to the accusations, Omamo defended the ministry, insisting they had appealed against some of the court rulings that awarded some former soldiers millions in damages.
