With Christine Nderitu Overconsumption of sugary drinks is a major contributor of obesity particularly among children. In an effort to control the growing burden of obesity, the World Health Organisation, in 2016, recommended taxing sugary drinks. According to a study, Impact of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes on purchases and dietary intake: Systematic review and meta-analysis, published in the Obesity Reviews Journal in 2013, a rise of the price of sugary drinks by 20 per cent could result in a 20 per cent reduction in consumption, consequently preventing obesity. The recommendation has increasingly been adopted, particularly in the developed countries. In Berkeley, California, one of the cities where the tax was implemented, a study showed a 52 per cent decline in consumption of sugary drinks among low-income residents, three years after the tax was enforced. According to the study, which reviewed Spain, France, Mexico and Chile and four US cities that have implemented the tax, a 10 per cent tax on sugary drinks reduced purchase and consumption of sugary drinks by 10 per cent showing that taxation is indeed effective in reducing consumption of these beverages. Individual studies showed that applying the tax based on the sugar content of a product was more useful in determining the impact, compared to having a standard percentage of price. For producers, this has resulted in the reformulation of products so that they have less calories, which is another possible advantage- that we will have more production and consumption of healthier drinks. Although obesity is highest in developed countries, the numbers have been growing exponentially in developing countries. Consumption of sugary drinks has also increased in the developing countries exacerbating the obesity, calling for the need to enforce the tax recommendation. This policy can, however, not work alone. We still need a lot of public education and regulations on the products, including how they are marketed.
