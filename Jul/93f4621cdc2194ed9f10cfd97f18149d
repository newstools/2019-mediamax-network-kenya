Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja (pictured) has been summoned by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in relation to the long standing grazing conflicts between farmers and non-local herders. The governor confirmed receiving the summon yesterday to visit the DCI’s Nairobi offices today. “This is to inform the general public that the governor, being a law abiding citizen will honour the summons and will appear before DCI on Monday July  8 at 08.30. He calls upon leaders to continue fostering peace and harmony,” read a statement sent to Newsrooms by Director of Communications, Dennis Onsarigo. Already over 20 camels have been killed by residents with Samboja maintaining that all illegal camel herders must be flushed out. Camel owners, however, claim to have  obtained leases from residents and ranch owners.
