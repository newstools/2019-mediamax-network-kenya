The government pledged yesterday to cater for the funeral expenses of fallen football legend Joe Kadenge who passed away on Sunday. Deputy President William Ruto reiterated the government’s support when he visited Kadenge’s family to condole with them yesterday, while describing the deceased as a “great sportsman and respected footballer”. “It is a great feat that one person can make such a big contribution to the game. Kadenge became synonymous with football in Kenya and we owe him a lot,” said Ruto when he visited the family’s home in Nairobi. Ruto added that the government will “stand and walk with the family of Mzee Kadenge during this difficult time”. Speaking at Lee Funeral Home where Kadenge’s body is lying, family spokesman Chris M’mbwanga said Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed visited the deceased home in Nairobi’s Mariakani Estate yesterday and also relayed the impending support with a budget of Sh5 million presented to the government to cater for the funeral expenses. Kadenge’s family announced that funeral plans have already began and a requiem mass will be held at Friends International Quakers Church on Ngong Road on July 17 after which the body will leave Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on July 18 headed to Kisumu from where it will proceed to Musambai Location, Vihiga County for internment on July 20. The former Maragoli and Abaluhya forward, who was described as Kenya’s finest player, died at a Nairobi hospital on Sunday aged 84, after a long illness.
