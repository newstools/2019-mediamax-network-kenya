More than 40 people in Kijani Ridge, Tatu City, have received construction and design approvals for their dream homes.  Fourteen of them have started constructing their homes, and will be the first residential community at the 5,000-acre development project. The approvals come almost three months after the Thika Environment and Land Court ordered Kiambu county government to process building approvals submitted by Tatu City developers within 30 days as provided in law. Tatu City, located in Kiambu, had moved to court on March 12, this year, accusing the county government  of disregarding a court order issued on April 18, 2018  directing  the Land, Housing, and Physical Planning department to consider submitted architectural plans within the 90-day period provided for under the Physical Planning Rules of 1998 pending determination of the case. The proprietors had claimed that Governor Ferdinand Waititu had instructed the Planning department not to approve any building plans associated with the project. Speaking during a breakfast meeting for Kijani Lakeside residents, the prospective homeowners commended Tatu City  for its controlled development environment.  “I know the future value of my investment is protected by high-quality infrastructure and controlled neighbourhood design. We all will sleep well at Kijani Ridge, knowing that we will never wake up to surprises around our homes,” said Dickson Magecha, one of the first investors. Tatu City is a mixed-use development project with homes, schools, offices, a shopping area, medical clinics, nature areas, a sports and entertainment complex and a manufacturing area. It can accommodate 150,000 residents and tens of thousands of day visitors.  Schools and businesses are already open at the City, and houses are under construction to suit all income levels.
