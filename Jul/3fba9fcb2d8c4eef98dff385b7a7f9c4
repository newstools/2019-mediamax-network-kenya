Preparations for this year’s Kenya Inter-Counties Sports and Cultural Association (Kicosca) Games have started in Kericho, the host county. Several venues for the games have been spruced up ahead of the next month’s 7th edition of the Kicosca Games, which will attract over 7,000 participants for various games from all the 47 counties in Kenya. At the Kericho Green Stadium, where major events will be hosted, works have already started with constructions of an additional pavilion, toilets and lighting systems alongside other amenities. Tenders awarded Other venues for the games include, Kericho Teachers’ College playing grounds and those in schools in the suburbs of Kericho Town. “Construction of some of the amenities at the Kericho Green Stadium and some other venues are ongoing. They will be ready by August. We also expect to lay tartan track at the stadium as soon as possible. Bids for the tenders have been awarded for the same. So we’re ready and in fact raring to go,” said County Chief Public Relations Officer Timothy Kemei. Kemei said everything concerning the games is on course and assured every department charged with the issue is up and running. Meanwhile Kicosca Games national governing council chair Peter Ogaro recently said that he was happy with the arrangements by the Kericho County to host the games saying everything that appertains to the upcoming games were up and running. “We expect all the counties to participate in this year’s games because last year in Kisii County we had only 36 counties out of 47, so I urge participants to prepare early enough for the national sports extravaganza,” said Ogaro. Last month, Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony said the county was ready and fully prepared to host the games next month saying they are raring to go. He assured all of the 24 hours security during the national event.
