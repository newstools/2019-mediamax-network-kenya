Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Former Chief Justice Bernard Chunga yesterday declined an appointment to chair a taskforce on the establishment and operationalisation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP). He declined the offer following an uproar from magistrates, judges and lawyers over the decision by DPP Noordin Haji. The former CJ said he had changed his mind following the uproar and thanked Haji for the offer. Chunga’s change of mind came a few hours after Chama cha Mawakili moved to court to block his  appointment to head the taskforce. The lobby group, through its director Georgiadis Majimbo, argue that Chunga is unfit to hold public office. According to the lobby group, which deals with public litigation, Chunga’s appointment was contrary to the Constitution as it was not preceded by any form of merit or fair competition. It is their argument that appointments in public service should be based on principles of accountability, merit and competition and Chunga’s appointment is unreasonable and contrary to Article 47 of the Constitution due to his record of gross human rights violations. “Unless this court grants conservatory orders suspending the task force, this petition will be rendered nugatory because the task force will have within 30 days deliberated, reported and dispersed by the time the petition is heard and determined,” stated Majimbo in an affidavit.
