Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Controversial blogger Robert Alai was yesterday granted a cash bail of Sh300,000 or a bond of Sh500,000 after denying charges of treachery for publishing photos of officers killed in Wajir IED attack. He appeared before Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi. Alai is  accused of committing the offence on June 17 “at an unknown place within the Republic of Kenya”. The court heard that, with intent to aid al Shabaab activities, he shared a photo of police officers killed by the militia on WhatsApp,  an act meant to interfere with maintenance of public order. He is also accused of disclosing photographs of the deceased officers to the public through Twitter handle @RobertAlai. With others not before court, Alai is said to have disclosed the images which were likely to prejudice investigations. Through his lawyer Paul Muite, the blogger asked for favourable cash bail, saying he has been in custody since June 19, waiting for the police to complete investigations. If found guilty, he faces life in prison. The matter will be mentioned on July 16 and heard on August 8.
