Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Online taxi drivers yesterday downed tools to protest little pay and long working hours. The drivers also cited the collapse of a memorandum of understanding with their service providers in July last year. The drivers from Uber, Bolt— formerly Taxify— and Little Cab decried low earnings from their businesses despite inking an agreement with the firms to increase rates charged. Anti riot police officers dispersed the demonstrators, who had gathered at Uhuru Park. They had intended to march to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s office to present their grievances. The operators accused the service providers of not adjusting their charges despite the increased cost of living triggered by high prices of fuel. No relenting In what could temporarily cripple the industry,  the drivers demanded an increase of minimum fee charged from the current Sh16 to Sh42 per kilometre for Uber. Little Cab and Bolt, the operators want the rates adjusted from Sh20 and Sh14, respectively, to Sh45. “This has turned out to be a loss-making business,” said Digital Partners Society chairman Rhayan Kanyandong. The challenge, however, is that the companies thrive best on who has the lowest rates. Kanyandong said they will not relent  until their  demands are  fully addressed. In a  letter addressed to Transport CS James Macharia, the drivers claimed efforts to  engage stakeholders  have failed. “We are sad to report that nothing substantial has come out of the MOU todate because the digital taxi app companies never honored the deal citing diverse excuses,” the letter read in part.
