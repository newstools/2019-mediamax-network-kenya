Nicholas Waitathu and Cheloti Joshua @PeopleDailyKe The Jubilee government’s food security plan will fail unless the Ministry of Agriculture is more committed to implementing policies aimed at eradicating food shortages, a think-tank has said. Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development, an Egerton University based think-tank, says the ministry has been slow in developing and implementing policies. “Every time there is a food crisis, the government applies short-term interventions which do not resolve the problem,” Tim Njagi, a senior researcher at Tegemeo, said. He added: “Good policies are available and others are being developed but are unhurriedly implemented. This leads to low growth in the sector and even the ad-hoc measures employed do not help in solving the challenges facing the sector.” In a recent interview, Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri said a number of food security policies have been enacted and will be implemented. Kenya continues to supplement local production with imports, a situation that is discouraging to producers and consumers. The Economic Survey 2019 shows that Kenya imported food worth Sh174.8 billion in 2018 compared to Sh245.3 billion in 2017. Last month, the ministry said the country was staring at another food crisis unless maize is imported. The National Cereals and Produces Board has said it has three million bags in its stores which cannot sustain the country for more than a month. But the plan to import maize has been opposed by leaders from the maize-growing North Rift and Western Kenya. Speaking in Endebess sub-county in Trans Nzoia county on Saturday, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula dismissed the plan as a ploy by a few individuals to make huge profits. “Maize that farmers harvested last year is still in the stores and they cannot sell. Surprisingly, the government has announced that 12 million bags of maize will be imported,” said Wetang’ula.
