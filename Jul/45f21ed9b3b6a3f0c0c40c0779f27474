Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Restructuring of the National Police Service, which has seen thousands of AP officers absorbed into the regular unit, has had a host of challenges, among them disparities in the nature of training, open rivalry and disaffection between the units. Yesterday, sources from police headquarters and the National Police Service Commission (NPSC) told People Daily the changes may necessitate retraining for some officers to effectively execute the new roles. Though most APs have joined the Kenya Police Service (KPS) where investigations of crimes will be one of their key functions, especially at the station level, they lack training in crime prevention and investigation. The merger will effectively boost physical police presence in general duty deployment by almost double under singular command of station bosses. “Although the police training curriculum was changed, the training of officers from the two services is distinct. More should also be done to harmonise the frosty relations,” a source said. Promotional system However, other sources dismissed reports that KPS officers are better trained and handle station matters better. “The training of both services are almost similar except that KPS have a course on police station management,” said the NPSC commissioner. Also the promotion system of the AP is different. Officers don’t need mandatory promotional courses, unlike their regular counterparts. In one of the cases that manifested disharmony between the two services last December, a Rapid Deployment Unit platoon attached to Kapendo Camp laid siege at Mandera Police Station and forcefully rescued a prisoner. The near fatal confrontation sparked crisis meeting at Jogoo House in Nairobi to quell the rising disunity. The meeting resolved that an officer involved be rearrested and charged in court.
