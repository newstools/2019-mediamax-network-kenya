By Christine Musa and Alvin Mwangi Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki on Friday received 1.9 million doses of measles vaccines stock at Kitengela vaccine depot. “I assure the public that there is no shortage of vaccines.  The vaccines are here and are going to be distributed to county hospitals in the coming weeks,” she said. The CS added that the country had already received a consignment of the oral vaccine, which is currently being offloaded at the Embakasi Inland Depot. She said the ministry also received 2.5 million doses of polio vaccine last month that will be distributed across the country to avoid shortages. The Sh215 million vaccines will last four months. Her assurance comes amid claims that there is a biting shortage of the crucial drugs. The government on Thursday refuted claims that the country is facing a shortage of polio vaccine, saying it was well prepared to ensure no shortage occurs. “There is no need for alarm, we have enough medicine,” she said. There were claims that by Monday next week, some newborns would not receive the vital vaccine owing to the alleged shortage. She said the national government would be holding joint consultation with  counties to help develop interventions that will help uphold high standards in delivery of health services, a devolved function. Meanwhile, Sicily has urged Kenyans to be critical of what they eat to protect themselves from lifestyle diseases such as cancer. “We need to return to our traditional lifestyles by consuming indigenous foods and observe customary ways of cooking and preserving foods as this will mitigate against illness,” the Cs observed.
