Lionel Messi is enjoying the final few days of his well-earned break from football as he relaxed with his family in the Caribbean. The Barcelona star went for a dip in the sea with his wife Antonella before chilling with his close friends and family at the Jumby Bay Resort in Antigua. Antonela has given fans brief snippets into her family’s vacation as Messi unwinds before heading back for pre-season training. It is unconfirmed when Messi will return to Catalonia to begin next season’s preparations but Barcelona have confirmed that the Argentine will be back to captain the side against Arsenal on August 4. Following his Copa America heartbreak, Messi is expected to return by the end of July after being given extra time off to recover which means he will miss the club’s tour of Japan. The 32-year-old was handed a one-match ban and a £1,200 fine on Tuesday evening after he was sent off in Argentina’s Copa America third-place playoff with Chile earlier this month. Messi will miss Argentina’s first 2022 World Cup qualifying match as a result of the ban. He also hit out at CONMEBOL by accusing them of being ‘corrupt’ but the South American football governing body backed down from imposing a tougher sanction on the forward. Messi’s comments came after he refused to collect his bronze medal following the contentious red card at the Copa America.
