WINDHOEK, The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) on Tuesday released the first national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Baseline Report, aimed towards efforts enhancing an evidence-based policy planning process. The report serves as an indicator framework and portal towards enhancing and improving planning as well as ensuring streamlined and harmonised monitoring of the implementation of the SDGs in Namibia and the Fifth National Plan (NDP5).
Speaking at the launch in the capital, NSA Statistician General (SG) and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Shimuafeni said the report will serve as a reference on how Namibia is monitoring the SDGs and the progress towards the achievement of the targets until 2030.
He said Namibia joined the international community in the call for action and recognises that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs through reliable knowledge on the state of the country.Â (Xinhua/Nampa)
