Muthaiga OCS Alphonce Kemengua was on Friday interdicted even as his deputy and the police officer in charge of prisoners endured hours of grilling over reports that State House digital director Dennis Itumbi and his friends were allowed unlimited access in the station past legal hours. The friends of Itumbi are said to have been allowed inside the station with a mattress, blankets and food where they took photos that they later shared on social media. Politician Josiah Murigu, however, yesterday denied reports that they held a party at the station. “What is there to celebrate when someone is arrested?” he asked, adding that it is normal to carry food for suspects held in custody. Murigu said they were given permission by the officers to see Itumbi and left when they were instructed to. Focus on case “They should stop punishing Itumbi and focus on the case. It is strange that since he was taken to the station, no officer has interrogated him or recorded his statement,” he said. On Saturday, Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirichi accused Interior Principal secretary Karanja Kibicho of instigating the arrest and prosecution of Itumbi. She claimed the arrest was part of a plan aimed at intimidating leaders supporting Deputy President William Ruto ambitions. Speaking at Kirigo village in Kirinyaga Central constituency during the issuance of a Sh100,000 cheque to women groups, the outspoken MP termed the arrest as political and warned that no amount of intimidation will stop them from supporting Ruto. She said the letter said to have been authored by Itumbi was a public document, which was circulated even by bloggers, and it was in bad faith to single out Itumbi as the person behind it.
