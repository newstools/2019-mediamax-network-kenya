Five Jubilee MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto have accused some public servants of breaking the law by engaging in politics. Speaking at a church service in Kinoo, Kikuyu sub-county on Sunday, they told the civil servants to resign and join politics instead of allegedly using their positions to undermine the Deputy President and his allies. MPs Nelson Koech (Belgut), John Kiarie (Dagoretti South), Jude Njomo (Kiambu Town), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu) and Githua Wamacukuru (Kabete) said some public servants were actively engaging in 2022 politics. “They should resign and join us in the political arena where we can wrestle openly,” said Koech. Ichung’wa accused Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho of instructing officers in his ministry to disrespect Ruto. He said he had received death threats for being a supporter of the DP. Githua called on politicians to stop politicking at the expense of development. ODM plot “Both Tanga Tanga and Kieleweke or any other political group ought to concentrate on serving Kenyans instead  of exposing them to high voltage politics,” he said. Koech urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to support Ruto’s bid to succeed him in the 2022 election. Njomo claimed he had rejected overtures by ODM MPs to take over the Parliamentary Budget and Appropriations committee chairmanship currently occupied by Ichung’wa.
