Irene Githinji @gitshee Wiper leader  Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday dismissed claims of a rift in the party, days after Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana resigned as chairman . He downplayed the exit of his ally-turned-critic, saying people are free to chart own path if not satisfied at the party. Kalonzo, however, said it should not be misconstrued to mean there is a fallout in the political outfit. He made the remarks during the Wiper National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the party’s headquarters in Nairobi yesterday, where a party retreat was planned for later in the month  to put the house in order. Kalonzo said Kibwana’s decision did not come as a surprise as the latter has not been attending most party meetings. “This (Wiper) is a major movement which is aiming at the top seat of this country,” he said, describing Wiper as “the most cohesive political party today”. No fallout “The only thing I want to tell you is that there is no fallout. Do not create rifts where there are none,” he added. Wiper vice chair and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr said the NEC deliberated on various issues, including how to rebrand and restructure the part ahead of the 2022 General Election. The rebrand could include a name change. Mutula dismissed reports that former Cabinet minister, Chirau Ali Mwakwere had already been picked to replace Kibwana as chairman. “Thank you for proposing him, but we will consider the proposal at the retreat this end month, ” he said.
