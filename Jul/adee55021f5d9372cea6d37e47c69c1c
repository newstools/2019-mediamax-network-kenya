Shawn Osimbo in Cairo Senegal coach Aliou Cisse has stoked up the fires ahead of today’s Group C Africa Cup of Nations tie against Kenya, telling Harambee Stars coach Sebastian Migne and his squad to mind their own business. Migne had fired the first salvo by insisting Senegal is full of individual performance but hard to gel as a group, comments Cisse took great exception to. “Concerning the Kenyan coach who was talking about the mentality of Senegal and the players, I would tell him to mind his own business. He should not judge our mentality. For four years, we have been number one in Africa, we have been to the World Cup. They (Harambee Stars) should deal with their own issues and stop talking about Senegal’s mentality,” said Cisse. Kenya need a win to progress to the last 16, although a draw could still do, after beating Tanzania 3-2 in an entertaining East African derby on Thursday and there were hopes that the Teranga Lions, who have already qualified, might field a second string squad, giving Harambee Stars a slight advantage.  However, going by the sentiments, there will be no favours, meaning Migne’s work is well cut out. “They have so many qualities not only physically and the calibre of almost all the players is high. They have maybe one of the best players in the world in Sadio Mane so we know it will be difficult but it is a privilege for all of us to be there,” said Migne. He added: “What is important for my team is not to forget that without team spirit, it will be difficult to challenge Senegal. In terms of individuals we cannot compete but if we put up a good team spirit, everything is possible.” Midfielder Johanna Omollo, who scored the second goal  against Tanzania reiterated Migne’s sentiments, saying: “Our motivation is to write something in Kenyan football. It’s been long since we have been in this tournament and every player is making a debut here. The fans are encouraging us and we are excited.”
