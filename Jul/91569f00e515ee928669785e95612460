Trade and Industrialisation Cabinet secretary Peter Munya yesterday questioned why a privately-run petrol station was operating within the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZ) in Athi River, an area meant for businesses producing goods for export. Speaking when he toured the plant, Munya asked how the petrol station was licensed to operate despite clear guidelines regarding export zones. “All businesses under EPZ umbrella should be dealing with products for export and not otherwise. The petroleum dealer is breaking the law unless EPZ proves that they mine oil for export. This is impunity of the highest level,” he said. EPZ chair Paul Gicheru said: “It (the station) was licensed by the former regime. We were also shocked when it was set up within this zone.” He said the petrol station is operating without a valid business licence since EPZ’s current management has revoked its papers.
