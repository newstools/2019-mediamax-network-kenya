Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Health experts have raised the red flag over rising cases of obesity in the country, saying it is the second leading killer lifestyle disease worldwide after cancer. Speaking during a symposium organised by Mt Kenya University’s college of health on strategies for obesity epidemic, Rose Ngugi, a lecturer at the university urged Kenyans to limit visits to the gym and manage what they eat. Alarmingly, Dr Ngugi said obesity affects 23 per cent of the current world’s population with young children contributing 18 per cent. “Obesity is a lifestyle disease that can be controlled from our eating habits,” said Ngugi. The experts asked authorities to heavily tax unhealthy foods. They also urged Kenyans to adopt the habit of visiting hospitals for routine medical checkups. “Make a habit of seeing the doctor for checkups. Exercise for 10 minutes per day,” added Ngugi. Among those in attendance were MKU Vice Chancellor, Prof Stanley Waudo, Dr Jane Kamau (KU), Dr Ronald Mbiine (Makerere University), Dr Josephat Njuguna (MKU) and Prof Jaydeep Palep from the Department of Bariatric and Minimal Access Surgery, Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, India.
