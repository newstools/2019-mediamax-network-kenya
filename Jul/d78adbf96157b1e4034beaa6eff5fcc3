Bernard Gitau and Ann Nyathira @PeopleDailyKe The Ministry of Information has defended its move to charge digital businesses under the Ajira Fund Sh10,000. Amid queries over the levy Principal secretary Jerome Ochieng said taxation for digital economy earners has been misinterpreted as a way to curtail employment for the youths. “The tax was actually suggested by youths who have benefited from the Ajira programme in a bid to help them get tax compliance certificate,” said Ochieng. Ochieng was speaking at the Kenya School of Government induction of 400 Presidential Digital Talent Programme Cohort four, where he said more than 900 university graduates have been trained since 2015. “The programme aims at digitising government ministries and instilling entrepreneurial skills,” he said. During the reading of 2019/20 financial year Budget statement last month, Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich said the digital economy is fast evolving thereby posing challenges to taxation. “This is due to the unparalleled reliance on intangibles, the massive use of data, the widespread adoption of multi-sided business models and the difficulty of determining the jurisdiction in which value creation occurs,” said Rotich. One-off fee The Sh10,000, said Rotich, will provide stability for the youth engaged in the programme. The one-off fee would cover the next three years in lieu of income tax with effect from January 1, next year. He proposed to amend the Income Tax Act in order to exempt registered members from regular taxation for the specified period.
