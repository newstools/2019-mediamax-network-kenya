National basketball men’s team, Morans, leave this morning for Bamako, Mali where they are set to take part in the inaugural senior men’s basketball Afro-CAN (African Nations’ Championship), that tips off on July 19 to 29. The fixtures released on Monday by FIBA for the competition, which brings together 12 countries competing in four pools, had pitted Kenya in Pool B against Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria. Pool A has hosts Mali playing Cote d’Ivoire and Algeria, while Pool C will feature Angola, Morocco and Chad. Tunisia, Egypt and Guinea are in Pool D. Kenya qualified for the Afro-CAN competition after wins against arch-rivals Egypt, Tanzania and Uganda to clinch their maiden title in last month’s FIBA Africa Zone Five championship held in Kampala, Uganda. “We picked our lessons in Uganda and we are building on that. At our best, the team can achieve anything. Zone Five was good exposure especially for the locally-based players and going to Mali will help improve the players’ confidence as well,” said head coach Cliff Owuor. Morans fell to Rwanda in the Zone Five championship; a defeat the tactician says humbled them and taught the squad that at their lowest they are beatable. “We know we did not do our best in the Rwanda match but we won the championship because we were the best team. We are building on that momentum going forward. We have been working on our technical aspect of the game as well as our fitness levels. This is going to be a tough tournament and we needed the players to be physically ready for the grind. We have also taken time to work on our mental strength,” said Owuor.
