This comes amid revelations that no crime has been solved as a result of the camera installation. Instead, perpetrators have got away with murder, robbery, and carjacking, among other crimes. There are 2,100 CCTV cameras installed at the taxpayers’ cost in all major roads in Nairobi and Mombasa. Detect crimes Senate Committee on Security, Defence and Foreign relations yesterday questioned the reliability of the security cameras and why they have failed to detect and prevent crimes in the wake of the high profile assassinations in recent years. The committee, chaired by Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, specifically questioned why the installations in Nairobi have not helped solve the murders of former Kabete MP George Muchai and businessman Jacob Juma. The cameras and command centres were set up with a promise they would make the city and other major towns safer. “The principal purpose of these cameras is to detect and prevent crimes, however, we are left to wonder why they have not helped police to apprehend suspects,” Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika said. The team, which was meeting Interior administrative secretary Patrick ole Ntutu and National Police Service officials, heard that the command unit at Jogoo House had no CCTV data primary storage. Ntutu said data is only stored for 30 days hence the difficulties in helping police with investigations.
