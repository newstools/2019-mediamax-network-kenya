Lewis Njoka @LewisNjoka Actis, a growth markets investor and Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate (Spre) yesterday launched a Sh12 billion residential housing project in Nairobi that seeks to address the shortage of middle income homes. The project, named Mi Vida Homes, will deliver more than 2,000 residential units. The first project will be constructed within the Actis’ Garden City mixed use development, where 624 residential units will be put up on a 4.5 acre parcel of land, adjacent to Garden City mall. Construction of the first phase, comprising 208 units, will commence in the third quarter of the year. Koome Gikunda, director Actis, said the project will bridge an expertise and capital gap that currently exists within the housing sector. “Over the last 15 years, we have established that there is a notable lack of institutional quality homebuilders with the expertise, capital and consumer trust to truly address the opportunity at scale. We are, therefore, confident that this venture is designed to bridge this gap and offer a great investment opportunity for local home buyers within the middle income market,” said Gikunda. The joint venture project will be managed by Chris Coulson, the managing director, Garden City. “I am very pleased and excited to lead this project and look forward to driving the development and execution of the platform’s corporate strategy,” said Coulson.
