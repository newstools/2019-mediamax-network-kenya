Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has warned traders who still stock and sell plastic bags in Kisumu that they risk arrest. At the same time the agency  has put on notice institutions or facilities that lack proper mechanisms to discharge liquid waste. County director of environment Tom Togo said the authority has embarked on a crackdown of traders selling the banned plastic bags, adding that eight traders have so far been arrested and charged with violating the directive. He said the crackdown also targets facilities such as hospitals, schools, industries, hotels, residential flats and petrol stations adding that those that lack effluent discharge licence will be closed until they comply. He  said that the prison facilities in the county that have for long been accused of discharging raw sewer into water points in the area have since complied. The authority is also locked in a legal tussle with the Kibos Sugar Company over closure of the miller over claims of effluent discharge into the nearby river Kibos.
