Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi State House Digital Communications director Dennis Itumbi was yesterday released on a Sh100,000 cash bail after being in police custody for seven days. The prosecution wanted Itumbi detained for nine more days but Nairobi Senior resident Magistrate Zainab Abdul dismissed the application. She ruled that no material had been placed before the  court to show that the suspect would interfere with witnesses, who are MPs and Cabinet secretaries, as claimed by the prosecution. The magistrate further said Itumbi’s statement was taken on Tuesday, and his incarceration was not necessary. “It has been clearly demonstrated that his incarceration is not necessary by the action of the investigating officer taking his statement only yesterday (Tuesday). The court has not been told how he will assist with the investigations while in custody,” she ruled. Abdul directed Itumbi (pictured) to report at Muthaiga Police Station once in two days, excluding  weekends, for the next nine days. She further directed the DCI to release his mobile phones and Sim cards in the next 14 days. Itumbi has been linked to a letter alleging an assassination plot against Deputy President William Ruto. The matter will be mentioned on July 22.
