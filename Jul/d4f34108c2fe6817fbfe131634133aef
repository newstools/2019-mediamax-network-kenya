Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) has applied to participate in the ownership dispute of the controversial land on which Weston Hotel in Nairobi stands, on the basis that it is the registered chargee. The bank said it has beneficial interests in the property, in which the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) secured orders on June 21 blocking the valuation, subdivision, sale and transfer of the land. “It is necessary to enjoin KCB in these proceedings to protect its interests and enable the court to fully determine the issues arising,” the bank stated in court papers filed by Mohamed Muigai Advocates. Bank Secretary Bonnie Okumu explained in a supporting affidavit that Weston Hotel received loan facilities of Sh350 million and USD1.5 million by a charge dated October 9, 2014, that was registered on October 27, 2014. The firm reportedly secured further Sh700 million by a further charge dated July 8, 2015, and registered on July 27, 2015. Okumu said the bank relied on confirmation by the Registrar of Lands that Weston Hotel was the duly registered owner of the property. “If the bank is not enjoined as an interested party, there is a real risk that KCB may be rendered a bystander as orders which are adverse to its beneficial interests as granted to KCAA,” he said.
