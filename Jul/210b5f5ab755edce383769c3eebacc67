Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi One of the accused persons convicted over the Garissa University terror attack was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment while two others were jailed for 41 years. Rashid Charles Mberesero was sentenced to life imprisonment for committing a terrorist act which claimed 148 lives in the university. “The accused person had indicated he was going to join al-Shabaab in Somalia and he was found at the scene of the crime, I sentence him to life imprisonment for commission of a terrorism act,” ruled Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. The other two; Mohamed Abdi Abdikadir and Hassan Edin Hassan were sentenced to 41 years for conspiracy to commit the terrorism act, committing a terrorist act and being members of al-Shabaab. “I have noted that the two accused persons are remorseful they were not found at the scene of crime and were arrested at different place in Garissa and Mandera. Evidence against them does not make them as principal offenders but secondary offenders,” Andayi ruled. He sentenced them to 15 years for conspiracy to commit a terrorist act but reduced it to 10-and-a- half-years because of the four-and-a-half years they have been in custody. On commission of a terrorist act, he sentenced the two to 30 -years each but reduced it to 25 -years-and-a-half while being members of al-Shabaab, the two were sentenced to 20 years which was reduced 15 years and- a -half. “The lives lost were vulnerable, helpless, innocent students who were gathered together and therefore became an easy target. I however note the pre-sentencing report that the two accused persons are youthful and first offenders,” ruled the magistrate. He noted  that the commission of a terrorism act hurts many people yet the message is to the government which is unfortunate as innocent lives are lost.
