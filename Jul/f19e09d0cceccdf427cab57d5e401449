Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) missed its revenue collection target by a wide margin in the 2017/18 Financial Year. In a report tabled in the National Assembly, Auditor General Edward Ouko says KICC collected Sh620.8 million in revenue compared to the targeted Sh1.2 billion, a shortfall of Sh713.4 million or 53.5 per cent. Ouko said the amount was a huge drop from Sh1.3 billion collected in the 2016/17 financial year. “During the year under review KICC managed to collect local revenue amounting to only Sh 620.8 million compared to the budgeted amount of Sh1.2 billion resulting in a shortfall… that was not explained,” reads the report. Old debts Ouko also  raises queries  about long-standing debts owed to the facility by current and former tenants and ex-employees. The report says government ministries and departments owe KICC Sh696.7 million in rent arrears that has been outstanding for more than two years. He revealed  that the National Assembly owes KICC Sh47.3 million while defunct government ministries and departments are owed Sh60.6 million.  Former KICC staff owe the corporation Sh5.4 million, according to the report. According to the document, a Mohammed Loo owes the corporation Sh1.7 million, Bernad Asoro Sh1.2 million, Maurice Anyango Sh569.8million, Florence Saka Sh515 million, Feisal Lasker Sh357 million, Fred Akonya Sh303.3 million and Mwendia Samuel Kinyanjui Sh649.3 million. The report also says KICC runs the risk of losing Sh36 million in rent because the private secretary of a former president occupied an office in the building for three years without a lease agreement.
