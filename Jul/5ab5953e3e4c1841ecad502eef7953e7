DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Deputy President William Ruto has asked leaders to work together with development partners to ensure there was no duplication of funding of projects in their areas of jurisdictions. He expressed concern that there had been cases where some projects had been accounted for more than once. Speaking during the North and Northern Eastern Development Initiative (NEDI) leadership consultative forum at his Karen office, Nairobi, yesterday, Ruto said leaders must guard against replication of projects in their respective areas. “We do not want a situation where one programme is being accounted for more than once. We must guard against it because it will result in the abuse of resources,” said Ruto. The Deputy President urged leaders to always take the lead in helping the people prioritise projects that have direct impact on their lives besides participating in their implementation. “The National and county governments should work together with MPs and development partners in projects as well as their monitoring to avert any unnecessary photocopying of such programmes,” he said. Ruto added that accountability remained key to successful implementation of development projects that would transform the lives of Kenyans.
