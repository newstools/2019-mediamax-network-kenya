Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru yesterday made good her threats to sack all striking county health workers. The decision came days after the Employment and Labour Relations Court declared the strike illegal. Last week, Waiguru directed the striking doctors to resume work with immediate effect. The doctors, however, refused to honour the order after the governor extended an olive branch to them. In his ruling last Thursday, Justice Nzioka Mutua said the doctors’ strike is unlawful. He gave the governor a directive to fire the striking doctors at her volition after they refused to report to work over the sacking of county casual workers. “Any officer who did not report to work by Monday 8th July stands dismissed and should collect their letters of termination from their previous duty stations,” said Waiguru in a press statement yesterday as quoted by Citizen Digital. She also said her government will embark on the process of replacing the fired doctors. The governor, who is also a former Devolution Cabinet Secretary, said her leadership will do everything within its reach to provide better healthcare for residents as long as she remains in office. The doctors had affirmed that they will not report to work unless their demands are met. And yesterday, Waiguru said her patience with the striking workers had run out.
