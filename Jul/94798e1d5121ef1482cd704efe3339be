Nairobi, Wednesday The UN said today that conflict had intensified in a region of South Sudan since a peace deal was signed, with hundreds of civilians raped or murdered by warring factions. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said civilians had been “deliberately and brutally targeted” in Central Equatoria since the agreement was inked in September. At least 104 people had been killed in attacks on villages in the southern region, it said. A roughly similar number of women and girls were raped or suffered other sexual violence between September and April, it said in its latest human rights report. Many were taken captive by armed groups to serve as “wives,” it said. The surge in violence has forced more than 56,000 civilians to flee their homes, becoming displaced in South Sudan itself, while another 20,000 have crossed the border into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. South Sudan descended into war in 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy and fellow former rebel leader Riek Machar of plotting a coup. The conflict has been marked by ethnic violence and brutal atrocities, and left about 380,000 dead while some four million have fled their homes. UNMISS said overall there had been a “significant decrease” in violence across the country since Kiir and Machar signed the deal. “However, Central Equatoria has been an exception to this trend, particularly in areas surrounding Yei, where attacks against civilians have continued,” the report said. -AFP
