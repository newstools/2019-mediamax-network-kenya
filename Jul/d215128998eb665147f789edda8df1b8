Hillary MagekaÂ @hillarymageka Senate Energy committee has recommended investigations into the cause of the oil spillage in Kiboko area, Makueni county, and those found culpable arrested. The committee, chaired by Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina, also wants a special audit done on a punctured section of the 450km Mombasa-Nairobi oil pipeline that caused oil leakage into Kiboko River. Their move came as three ministries and two State agencies openly differed on whether the water in the area affected by oil spillage is fit for human consumption. While an inter-ministerial report submitted to the committee showed that water in Kibiko river and Mutiso springs is fit for domestic use, the National Environment Management Authority cautioned residents against using the water for human consumption as it had been polluted.
