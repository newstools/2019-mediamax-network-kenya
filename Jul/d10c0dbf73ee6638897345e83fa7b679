Last week I narrated to you how the boss is going spare over the lodging business, to the point of contemplating demolishing the ‘fun’ rooms should the strange noises emanating from them not cease soon. But that’s a stale story now. The old man is losing the plot if not his mind, because most of the business decisions he is making border on absurdity.

People go where there is good music and a comfortable, adequate dance floor. If you kill these two, this place will be dead.” “You will be dead before this club dies,” he shouted at me. “Do not get it twisted! We run a bar and not a dance hall club!” he scoffed. “I will have a solution to this madness tomorrow morning.” Come Saturday, the elaborately constructed dance floor was no more, as the boss had abolished it, taking with it the fun and memories…
