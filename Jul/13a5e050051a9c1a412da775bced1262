Cairo, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Before the Africa Cup of Nations kicked off in Egypt last month, Madagascar were best known for the tongue-twisting surnames of players such as Anicet Andrianantenaina and Charles Andriamahitsinoro. Now, 20 days into the biennial tournament, the Indian Ocean islanders have stunned three-time champions Nigeria and are preparing to face Tunisia on Thursday in the last quarter-final. While France-born coach Nicolas Dupuis insists “the team is the star”, midfielder Andrianantenaina and forward Andriamahitsinoro have caught the eye. Bulgaria-based Andrianantenaina was among the 11 footballers chosen by a Confederation of African Football (CAF) panel as the best in the 36-match group phase. Andriamahitsinoro, who plays for a Saudi Arabian club, made the substitutes’ list in the group ‘dream team’, and his two goals have put him in contention for the Golden Boot award. He stands out on the field because he has blond dyed hair and is tall in a squad of mostly medium-height footballers. Tunisia coach Alain Giresse says his first target of a last-eight place has been achieved, adding: “We are capable of lifting the trophy 15 years after doing so for the first time.”Madagascar and Tunisia have met competitively only twice with Tunisia winning 1-0 at home and 2-0 away in 2002 World Cup qualifying. Algeria vs Ivory Coast This clash extends one of the great rivalries in the tournament with the Ivorian Elephants winning three and the Algerian Desert Foxes two of seven previous meetings. When they last met, in a 2015 quarter-final, Ivory Coast triumphed 3-1 with Serey Die part of the winning team while the losing line-up included Riyad Mahrez. The midfielders, who have contrasting roles with Die primarily a destroyer and Mahrez a creator, captain the teams in Suez four years later.  -AFP
