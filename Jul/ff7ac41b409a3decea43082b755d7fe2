The Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) yesterday accused the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) of politicising the issue of MPs pay. Addressing the press in Nairobi, the  commissioners also denied reports of a plan to pay MPs a night allowance, saying it was  a creation of the media. PSC claimed SRC had allowed other independent commissions to earn house allowances but protests when MPs demand similar perks. Double standards “Why does it become an issue when Parliament implements what rightly belongs to members, while other independent bodies are allowed to implement their polices?” asked Eldas MP Adan Keynan. The commissioners claimed Cabinet Secretaries earn house allowances but are not reflected on their payslips. Taveta MP Naomi Shaban accused SRC of applying double standards. “The SRC has entered into deals with the Executive and the Judiciary on house allowances. Why does it become an issue when MPs, just like other State officers, claim the same allowance?” she posed The commissioners said MPs earn Sh532,500 and denied that they get more than a million shillings. They also denied reports that their salaries and allowances are not taxed. “Members of Parliament pay taxes on every salary or allowance and are not exempt,” read the PSC statement.
