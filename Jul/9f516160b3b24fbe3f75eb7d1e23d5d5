Kinyuru Munuhe and Agencies @PeopleDailyKe Kenya has for the second time pushed to have Al-Shabaab listed as a terrorist organisation under the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1267. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma argued that doing so would strengthen efforts to counter the group’s activities. The CS spoke two days after 26 people, among them three Kenyans, were killed in a terror attack at Medina Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. “This attack is another reminder to the international community of the imperative to list the Al Shabaab, like all other terrorist groups, under the UNSC resolution 1267,” Juma said. A suicide bomber rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the hotel on Friday before several heavily armed men forced their way inside and shot at residents. It was the largest coordinated attack by the Shabaab in Kismayo since 2012 when it lost control of the city. Politicians The victims included several foreigners and Somali-Canadian journalist Nodan Halayeh, who  died with her husband. The hotel was packed with politicians and prominent businessmen as meetings were underway for upcoming presidential elections in Jubaland, due in August. In May this year, Kenya presented a similar appeal to the global community during talks between Juma and the European Union  High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini following the abduction of two Cuban doctors in Mandera. The terrorist network has posed regional security threat with Kenya bearing the highest burden through attacks staged in Kenyan soil by the militants.
