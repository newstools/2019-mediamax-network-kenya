Mutwiri Muriithi @mutwirimuriithi Agriculture and manufacturing sectors pay their employees the lowest according to employment trends in Kenya from 2014 to 2018. Compiled by the ICEA Lion Asset Management firm, the report shows that despite their huge contribution to the economy, agricultural producers and manufacturers remain heavily understaffed and underpaid. “The disparity points to the underperformance and lack of competitiveness in the sector to inform the need for a drastic turn-around in policy with a view to match the input in the sectors to the desired output,” said head of research Judd Murigi. The sectors contributed 34.2 and 7.7 per cent respectively to the country’s total output last year. Wage growth in agriculture and manufacturing has grown at an average of 25 and 22 per cent in five years respectively with job creation in the sector slowing to an average of one per cent over the period. An average worker in the two sectors receives a monthly stipend of Sh31,915 and Sh58,957 in 2018 according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.
