Parliament has threatened to recommend that all government entities banking with the National Bank of Kenya (NBK) close their accounts held by the institution following a decision by the management to decline audit. The National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee  (PIC) said the bank has failed to explain the position of the billions of shillings it holds belonging to key parastatals and other government agencies. The bank management was hard pressed to explain why it was opposed to audit by Auditor General, notwithstanding the fact the government holds 22.5 per cent in the institution. National Bank of Kenya is in the process of a take-over by KCB Bank. Among the key institutions which bank with NBK is the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which owns 48.1 per cent of the bank. The bank says the Auditor General has no mandate to audit its accounts, with the impasse holding the audit since 2013. Public Audit Act The bank’s Chief Executive Officer Wilfred Musau told the committee that its operations are steered by the Banking Act and not the Public Audit Act. “Due to this the bank can only be audited by a private statutory auditor,” he told the committee chaired by Mvita MP Abduswamad Nassir. Said Nassir: “The way you are putting it is as if Central Bank, Consolidated Bank, Post Bank and Development Bank which are all audited by the Auditor General are wrong and you are the only one who is right.” Musau further claimed that the fact that NBK was a listed company at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) made them different from the other banks. Nassir told the bank management that all listed companies where the government has some shareholding, including Kenya Power and Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) are also audited by the Auditor General.
