Patients admitted to Igegania Level Four Hospital in Gatundu North have raised concern over a foul smell emanating from a room near one of the wards, where all the hospital waste is dumped. The hospital, which has only four medics, is on the spot for lacking a functional incinerator. Residents have accused Kiambu County government of failing to construct a new incinerator or repair the old one, which broke down in 2014. “Some of us have been going to private hospitals because we cannot stand being served under such conditions. One nurse at the hospital has been serving more than 30 patients, under deplorable conditions,” said Mary Mwangi, a resident. Kariuki wa Makara, another resident, claimed that the hospital has no drugs and essential  non-pharmaceuticals such as gloves. Share beds “Governor Ferdinand Waititu should streamline the Health department. The hospital lacks an ambulance despite having  Level Four status. We feel forgotten,” said Mwangi. The concern comes days after a damning report compiled by Kiambu Assembly’s Health Committee exposed deep rot at the hospital. According to the report, children have been sharing beds with older patients in the female wards, which do not have curtains for privacy or shelves to place utensils and other personal items. Area MCA Martin Githaiga said delayed supply of drugs to the hospital is a ticking time bomb. “The foul smell is as a result of lack of an active incinerator. The previous one stopped functioning in 2014 and nothing has been done since. The hospital waste is piled together, including syringes, and is later collected and dumped elsewhere. This is unfortunate,” he said. Efforts to reach the county Health department for a comment were futile as our calls went unanswered.
