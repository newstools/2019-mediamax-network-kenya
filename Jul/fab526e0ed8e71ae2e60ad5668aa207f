Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has revealed that some  legislators from Central region have been attending development summits being held by Cabinet secretaries from the area. Speaking during a fundraiser at Sacred Heart Girls Secondary School-Mirithu in his constituency, he said he had attended several meetings at La Mada Hotel but never heard of the alleged scheme to assassinate Deputy President William Ruto. “Maybe there is one that I didn’t attend and the assassination plot was discussed but all those that I have participated in, we talked about development in our respective areas,” he said. Mwathi said Interior Principal secretary Karanja Kibicho usually  invites legislators to the meetings. Long overdue “We have the freedom of association and I wonder why it becomes a very big issue when leaders from our region meet and yet leaders from other regions meet every other month without raising eyebrows,” he said. Other lawmakers,who support the meetings, say the same were long overdue and should not be mistaken for tribal gatherings. They say the meetings have President Uhuru Kenyatta’s blessings and the leaders would continue holding the meetings until their objectives, which they say are apolitical, are met.
