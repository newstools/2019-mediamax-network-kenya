George Kebaso @Morarak The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) was last evening at pains to explain why its members were being turned away from some health facilities despite insisting the issue had been sorted. Reacting to the numerous reports, an officer from the fund instead blamed employers for not remitting their workers’ contributions on time. “There was no crisis as seen in some social media platforms. The only problem was that there were delays in renewing NHIF contracts with civil servants because employers failed to remit contributions on time,” the officer, who sought anonymity, told People Daily. On Monday, majority of NHIF contributors — mainly those attending high-end hospitals — complained that they were being turned away because the government insurer had not updated data of its members for the 2019/20 financial year. The members most affected, the officer said, are those on the enhanced cover introduced for contributors and their dependents. “Its actualisation, however, depends on the completion of the ongoing reforms at NHIF,” the officer said. The reforms include efficiency arising from the decentralisation of NHIF services and continued partnership with health providers on enhanced quality services to all members. Pumwani Maternity Hospital administrator Geoffrey Mosiria admitted there were delays by NHIF to reimburse health facility.
