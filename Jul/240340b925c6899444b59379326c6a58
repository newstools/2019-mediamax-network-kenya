James Magayi @magayijim Debutants at the CECAFA Club Championships Bandari stare at an early exit from the competition after a 2-2 draw against Rwanda’s Mukura Victory Sports in their second Group B game in Huye yesterday. The coastal club is marooned in third place on a paltry two points with one difficult fixture pending against defending champions Azam of Tanzania. The script veered from good when Bandari took the lead to worse when Mukura seized control in he 83rd minute before Yema Mwana mitigated for the Kenya outfit with an added time equaliser to leave the team’s chances hanging in the balance. Bandari got off to a splendid start when winger Shaban Kenga nodded them ahead with a beautiful finish after rising under challenge to meet Collins Agade’s lofted pass in the 32nd minute. Quick responce Agade was impressive at the midfield base and cooked the breakthrough with his visionary cross that picked out Kenga deep in opponents goal area. The game was a seesaw between the two antagonists with Bandari creating the most potent of chances. Kenga’s goal, however, stirred the hosts awake as they sought a quick response. One of the Mukura attacks caused Farouk Shikhalo to slam his head on the goal post trying to keep out a close range header that would have surely earned Mukura Victory Sports an equaliser. Bandari held on but had a penalty appeal turned downby referee Hassan Haggi in the 42nd minute when Yema Mwana appeared to have been clipped in the box. The Kenyans took the lead into half-time but conceded in the first minute of restart to a long-range drive by Saleh Nyirinkindi that skimmed off the upright on its way into the net. Buoyed by the leveller Mukura exercised dominance over Bandari in most of the second half but struggled to open their defence.
