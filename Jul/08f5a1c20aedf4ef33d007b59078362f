Amos Abuga @PeopleSport11 Kenya Polo Association is in the process of compiling the final women’s team to face Zambia in the Kenya International Championships to be hosted at Manyatta Polo Club from July 19-21. Association chairman Gordon Millar said the team will be unveiled towards the end of the week so that the players can have ample time to prepare. “That being an important game, the team will be made official soon enough. So far, we have analysed each player’s performance before the arrival of the Zambians,” Millar said. Meanwhile, Sandstorm are the champions of the Lord Cransworth Cup after humbling Whitecap 5-2 at the Nairobi Polo Club on Sunday.
