Irene Githinji @gitshee As new facets under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) are implemented, indigenous languages will be taken as optional subjects from Grade 4. Indigenous languages are to be introduced from Grades 4 – 9 because the learner will not only be embracing theories and practices but also because they will be exposed to a broad curriculum to allow them explore their interests and abilities. An education expert from the Ministry of Education clarified that there is nothing like summative evaluation and if a learner feels they are trying a certain language and they do not like it, they can just drop it adding that they will not be restricted to learn their own language. He said examinations will only come later on when a learner specialises in the language, particularly from Grade 10 – 12. Those with high ability will have an opportunity to take as many indigenous languages as possible. Huge demand The expert said indigenous language is not compulsory, hence a child, parent, teacher will have a chance to discuss whether a child will take that option. There will also be a conversation between parents, child and the school in instances of mixed marriages to arrive to a common decision on what the learner would prefer to study. “Nobody is being forced to study indigenous languages…just like , now, we have foreign languages such as German, French Arabic and people take them as optional subjects. We should not be fast to ask where the language will be used yet we can see the local language industry is growing, there is demand for local proficiency,” the expert, who sought anonymity explained. This is the seventh month since the Government rolled out Pre-Primary school and Grades 1, 2 and 3 nationally, with Grade 4 expected to be rolled out next year. The Basic Curriculum Framework provides that the course is to develop language skills acquired in lower primary in addition to attitudes and behaviour towards learning.
