A tug of war has emerged within Kiru Tea Factory over contact renewal with Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA). One faction, led by chairman Chege Kirundi, is demanding a review of the contract before the renewal for another tenure. Kirundi said the 10-year contract, which ended on June 30, has been oppressive to the farmer. Speaking in Murang’a, Kirundi said they are going to stand their ground. He said Kiru is not ready to sign a new contact until their demands are met. He said Kiru factory had given a two-year notice to the agency indicating they would like a review of the contract. “In 2017 we had written to KTDA telling them we want a review of the contract but they took no action” he said. Stephen Githiga, who leads the other faction, said the contract was renewed on February 2, last year. Githiga, who claims to be the legitimate chairman, said they signed a new contract in order to secure a Sh200 million loan to complete the orthodox tea processing plant. “KTDA had agreed to guarantee the loan. We were compelled to sign another contract” he said. He accused Kirundi of trying to deviate the factory from KTDA. “It is not acceptable for one person to close down a company just because he is aggrieved” said Githiga. Farmers from the factory, however, are demanding better terms of engagement with KTDA. The farmers claim that KTDA Management Service has refused to renegotiate and want the “old oppressive” contract to remain in force.
