Bernard Gitau @benagitau The Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) is set to evict over 1,000 small-scale traders, who have encroached on the pipeline wayleave at Kaptembwo, Nakuru county. KPC head of security Walter Ochieng has said an eviction notice issued two months ago has expired, and they are engaging the Interior ministry on the next course of action. He said the encroachment puts the traders and thousands of their customers at great risk in case of a fire outbreak. “It is dangerous for traders to continue operating along the pipeline, given that some light cooking fires oblivious of the danger they are exposed to in case of oil spillage. It’s better to prevent (harm)than to regret later,” he said. Ochieng expressed concern that even though the firm has held several meetings with the traders, they have remained adamant and vowed not to move. “The traders are also exposed to high electricity voltage as they are operating under the power line” he said. Insensitive According to the 2009 census, the ward has over 70,000 residents, who Ochieng said might be in danger in the event of a fire incident. Traders at Kaptembwo have, however, maintained that they must be allocated alternative trading spaces for them to move from the wayleave. Consolata Achieng’, a fishmonger and mother of six, says she has operated in the area for 15 years. “I have been eking out a living from this place for the better part of my life, if I will be evicted there must be an alternative,” she said. Joseph Karanja, a hawker, accused KPC and the county government of being insensitive to the welfare of small-scale traders. “It is our right to have a safe market before being evicted,” he said.  The looming eviction by KPC seems to be informed by the oil spillage in Kiboko area, Makueni county, four months ago.
