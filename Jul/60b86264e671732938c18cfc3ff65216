State House has moved to quell fears regarding the government’s move to allocate land to South Sudan for construction of a dry port at the Naivasha special economic zone. Spokesperson Kanze Dena said yesterday that the land is not necessarily being issued for free but to allow South Sudan a place to store their cargo while on transit. “The Naivasha land…It is a dry port used to encourage landlocked countries to store wares,” she said while addressing media at State House. “The land they are being given is not for free, it is for them to be able to put in their cargo while on transit. By South Sudan having a dry port there, it adds revenue so it is an investment opportunity,” Dena (pictured) added. Heightened debate The remarks come against the backdrop of heightened debate following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s move, earlier this month, to hand 10 acres to South Sudan to construct a dry port in Naivasha, Nakuru county. He said the land to be given at the Naivasha Industrial Park is not only geared towards easing the movement of goods to neighbouring countries but will also cut short the journey South Sudan makes to Mombasa to collect and clear goods destined for Juba. President Uhuru offered South Sudan land two weeks ago when he hosted his counterpart, Salva Kiir. “The government has responded to the request of South Sudan to set aside 10 acres at the Inland Container Depot in Naivasha industrial park, to ease the movement of goods destined to South Sudan,” he said. South Sudan will be the second country in the region to have a dry port in Naivasha, even as it emerged that more countries could be interested in a similar undertaking.In March, the government announced it will give land to Uganda for construction of a dry port in Naivasha.
