Hart the band, the three-member urban boy band comprising Mordekai Kimeu, Kenneth Muya and Wachira Gatama was an immediate sensation when it launched back in 2013. Their song Uliza Kiatu was catchy, relatable and heartfelt, and it earned them acclaim and a wide public following. Their later releases, including Nikikutazama, Rosella (featuring Lady Jay Dee) and Baby Love affirmed their place as a band for our times. Their approach to music through art and poetry defines and differentiates them from the rest. It was, therefore, a fun treat for fans when the band hosted a listening party at The Muze, Westlands. The event started later than planned. The band arrived at around 8pm to an already turned up crowd enjoying local music by the in-house deejay. They stepped onto the stage with Mordecai, the lead singer, kicking off the performance. It was a unique music experience that allowed fans the  opportunity to listen to the band’s new album and be treated to a performance by other artistes featured in the album. The event was attended by some of the city’s most beloved entertainers including boy band Sauti Sol, musician Gilad, comedian Kartelo and others. Speaking to PD Wikendi, they said, “We are glad this day came to pass and we were able to showcase what we have been working on for such a long time. This is just the beginning of an amazing journey and I hope we will continue supporting and playing local content.”
