Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The rivalry between the two Houses of Parliament has taken a new twist after it emerged that senators have weaved a law that if passed would guide the determination of bills coming from either of the chambers. The Determination of the Nature of Bills (Procedure) Bill 2018, sponsored by Senators Mutula Kilonzo Jrn (Makueni) and Nairobi’s Johnson Sakaja will require that before either House considers a bill, the Speakers of the National Assembly and Senate jointly resolve any question as to whether it is a bill concerning counties and, if it is, whether it is a special or an ordinary one. Currently, there is no legal framework on how the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament are to enforce concurrence on all the bills presented before them. The bill provides for the procedure for concurrence on all bills tabled in either Houses, the dispute resolution mechanism, or the consequences of non-concurrence on a bill. Advisory opinion “The bill provides for referral of a bill to the Supreme Court for advisory opinion in instances where the two Speakers fail to concur on whether the proposed law concerns counties and, if it is, whether it is a special or an ordinary one,” reads part of the bill. To deal with National Assembly’s trend of forwarding bills for assent without the concurrence of the Senate, the Lower House will be required to ensure that all bills are accompanied with a certificate of concurrence from Speakers of both Houses of Parliament before the Presidential Assent. The move comes after early this year; senators protested a move by the National Assembly to forward for assent the Health Laws (Amendment) Bill, without their involvement.
