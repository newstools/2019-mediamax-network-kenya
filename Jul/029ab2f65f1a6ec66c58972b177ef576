The Office of the Director of Criminal Investigations is investigating land hived off the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) acreage in Athi River for construction of a petrol station, management has said. According to EPZA chairman Paul Gicheru, the authority is awaiting a comprehensive report on the ownership of the illegal business while at the same time pushing for prosecution for the same. The building, which is operating without a licence, raised eyebrows following earlier reports by Business Hub. Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya on Tuesday asked how the petrol station was operating despite clear guidelines regarding export zones. Illegal pursuit “All business under EPZA umbrella should be dealing with products for export and not otherwise. The petroleum dealer is illegal unless EPZA can prove that they mine oil for export,” Munya said when he visited the authority. Earlier, when asked about the petrol station, situated along Namanga road, the company acting chief executive George Makateto was hesitant to respond on the matter but Gicheru later said the petrol station is operating without a valid business licence after management revoked it. Revoked licence “I can categorically state that the petrol station is operating illegally. We as the management revoked the illegally attained licence. This is an industrial zone that is strictly for export business,” said Gicheru. However, another business premises is being constructed right next to the petrol station. The petrol station branded Netgas began operating in March this year and Business Hub could not immediately establish the owner of the disputed business. Netgas sits on an estimated two-acre piece of land along the busy Nairobi-Namanga road at the border of Kitengela and Athi River towns.
