Four legislators have asked political leaders from Gusii region to stop misleading Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i that he is ripe for presidency. Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot and MPs Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba) and Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango) said although Matiang’i is a performer, he is not ripe for the country’s top job because of his political inexperience. Cheruiyot said those pushing the CS to run for presidency were not honest and genuine as they were out to con him. He accused  Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri and his Nyamira counterpart Okong’o Omogeni of misleading the community that civil servants from the area were appointed only by Uhuru Kenyatta. “Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto jointly appointed the officers serving the Jubilee government and therefore, it is wrong for some leaders to claim the slots given to the community were done by Uhuru alone. Speaking during a harambee in aid of Ignena Itambe Catholic Church in West Mugirango, Cheruiyot said the seat of presidency needs people with political experience. He advised Matiang’i to be careful not to be misled and asked him to rally his support behind Ruto assuring him that 2027, when he could have matured politically, the Kalenjin community would also support his bid. He said the Kisii community alone could not make Matiang’i win the seat  unless he gets backing from other communities. “By virtue of being good neighbours, let’s have a political alliance between the Kisii and Kalenjin communities,” said the senator warning those who were promoting divisive politics between the two communities to keep off.
