Anthony Mwangi and Mercy Mwai @PeopleDailyKe A firm contracted by the government to procure CT scan equipment at a cost of Sh7 billion did not produce procurement documents to the Auditor General, raising fears that due process was not followed. Auditor General Edward Ouko’s  report says the Ministry of Health paid Sh1.7 billion under specialised plant equipment and machinery paid for CT scans. “This was 20 per cent of the contract value, which was paid as a condition precedent for the government to obtain a loan of Sh7 billion from the government of China to finance the purchase of the CT scanners,” Ouko writes in his report of the year ended June 2018. The scanners were procured through Neusoft Medical Systems had been provided at the time of conclusion of the audit review. However, no procurement documents for the firm were provided to the Auditor General. The Chinese government proposed the firm, according to Ouko, as a leading manufacturer of CT scans. “Consequently, it was not possible to ascertain whether due diligence and fidelity to the Public Procurement and Assets Disposal Act, was observed,” Ouko says. Tender awarded Even though the deal for the purchase of the CT scanners was a government-to-government one, the ministry abandoned it and opted to award the tender to Neusoft Medical Systems Co Ltd. When the matter came before the Public Accounts Committee, the procurement process was also questioned. Committee chairman Opiyo Wandayi said the scanners should not have been procured as they fall under the same category of the medical equipment the government acquired at a cost of Sh42 billion and leased to counties in 2015. The ministry is on the spot over the acquisition of 100 portable clinics at accost of Sh1 billion. Meanwhile, Ouko has said there was no value for money for the Sh800 million that the government initially paid for the clinics.
