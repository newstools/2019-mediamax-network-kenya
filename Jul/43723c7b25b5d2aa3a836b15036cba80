Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka The burden of funding leaders’ globetrotting continues to unfold, with revelation that, like MPs, governors and MCAs spent billions of shillings in overseas trips. A report by the Controller of Budget (CoB) shows the 47 county governments spent about Sh15 billion on domestic and foreign travel between July 2018 and March 2019. Titled County Budget Implementation Review Report for the first half of the 2018/19 financial year, the document reveals that county executives spent a staggering Sh5.6 billion on domestic trips while MCAs used Sh3.7 billion on “benchmarking” local trips. The 47 governors and members of the executive spent Sh4.3 billion on foreign travel while county assemblies spent Sh1 billion on foreign visits during the same period. Domestic travel Kisii county incurred the highest expenditure on domestic and foreign travel at Sh764 million, followed by Garissa and Nairobi  at Sh653 million and Sh629 million, respectively. “The county governments incurred Sh14.8 billion on domestic and foreign travel during the period and comprised of Sh9.43 billion for domestic travel and Sh5.45 billion for foreign travel,” the report by Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo reads. “This expenditure was an increase of 112.3 per cent compared to Sh7 billion incurred in a similar period of the 2017/18 financial year,” it adds. This is the second time the Governor James Ongwae-led administration is taking the top position among counties in spending taxpayers’ money in unjustified allowances, domestic travel and foreign trips. In a similar report last year, Kisii county registered the highest expenditure on domestic and foreign travel at Sh323.7 million, followed by Turkana and Migori at Sh253.9 million and Sh250.9 million, respectively. If shared among the 47 county chiefs, the Sh14.8 billion spent on domestic and foreign travel, each of the governors would have consumed about Sh316 million in nine months on trips. This is the period when at least 14 counties were facing serious food shortages and starvation. According to the report, Governor Ali Korane (Garissa) spent Sh283 million on local trips and an equivalent amount on foreign travels, while and Mike Sonko (Nairobi) spent Sh274 million for domestic and an equal amount for overseas trips. The County Assembly of Garissa spent Sh86 million on local trips while Nairobi County Assembly incurred Sh48 million and Sh31 million for domestic and foreign trips, respectively. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua’s executive disbursed Sh220 million on domestic travel and almost a similar amount on overseas trips while the county assembly used Sh141 million on local and Sh31 million on foreign travels during the period under review. Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o used Sh204 million on local trips and a similar amount on foreign travel, while the county assembly spent Sh85 million on local trips and Sh19 million on overseas trips. Foreign trips Closing the top 10 highest county expenditure list is Homa Bay’s Cyprian Awiti, who spent Sh184 million on local and foreign trips. The report also shows that county assemblies blew Sh1.55 billion on MCAs committee sitting allowances against an approved budget of Sh1.2 billion. According to the CoB, the expenditure translates to 57.2 per cent of the approved MCAs committee sitting allowance budget and an increase of 131.1 per cent over a similar period in the 2017/18 financial year when Sh670 million was incurred. “Garissa and Tana River counties reported a higher expenditure on committee sitting allowances than the salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) recommended monthly ceiling of Sh124, 800,” CoB states.
