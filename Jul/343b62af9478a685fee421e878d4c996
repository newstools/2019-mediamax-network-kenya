Lewis Njoka @LewisNjoka Members of Metropolitan National Sacco are eagerly waiting to see whether it will make a full turnaround following the announcement of a restructuring programme being spearheaded by Cooperative Bank. The sacco, whose members are mostly teachers, has been reeling under the weight of financial distress due to rising bad loans which reduced its liquidity leaving it unable to meet its customers’ daily cash demands. Following the stress signals, Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority (Sasra) put the institution on the watch list last year to determine whether it had enough liquidity to service its more than 100,000 members. Last month, the sacco admitted it was experiencing financial difficulties caused by non-performing loans amounting to Sh1.2 billion. “It is true the sacco has been having some challenges,” said supervisory committee chairman Joseph Gachunga.  But in the deal signed between Cooperative Bank and Metropolitan, the bank, through Co-op Consultancy, will offer corporate advisory services in a bid to improve the Sacco’s long term stability. Funding requirements Co-op Consultancy will restructure the Sacco’s funding requirements so as to manage member monthly cash demands better and improve the institutions liquidity with the ultimate aim of achieving a full turnaround. Vincent Marangu (pictured left with Metropolitan chairman Christopher Karanja), director, cooperatives banking division at Co-operative Bank, said the bank had a strategic interest in the turnaround and long-term growth of the Sacco  saying it will ensure it has adequate working capital and improved efficiency. “We have done it before for a number of co-operatives, with huge success, and therefore this will be in line with our commitment to the co-operative movement,” said Marangu. Karanja said the restructuring, which commenced this month, had injected new impetus for growth at the Sacco.
