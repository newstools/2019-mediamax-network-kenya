Josephine Wawira Logistic challenges are hampering e-commerce growth in Africa even as more investors look to the continent, which is posed as the next big investment destination by 2030. African Development Bank (AfDB) considers costs due to dysfunctional market logistics a greater barrier to trade, more than the often touted tariffs and non-tariff barriers. In its 2019 African Economic Outlook, the lender points out that unsatisfactory national address systems and transport infrastructure are among the biggest logistics’ hurdles holding back growth in the sector. Lack of addresses Coupled with poor road networks, this has made it very difficult to make deliveries, with companies relying on fairly descriptive addresses and landmarks provided by the customers during the initial stages of the online purchases. Poor road infrastructure, heavy traffic that lead to delayed deliveries; cancelled orders for the on-demand services and subsequently loss of revenue have all led to use of alternatives. Motorcycles – popularly known as boda boda in Kenya – have taken up this space with some 1.2 million motorcycles intended for passenger transport business now tapping the ecommerce sector, to swiftly deliver products, especially within busy cities. “There are huge opportunities for logistics to grow e-commerce, but few established players exist in the market,” says Apoorva Kumar, Jumia’s SVP of Logistics. Present in 14 African countries, Jumia, which is one of the e-commerce sector players, eased delivery of products to consumers using both vehicles and boda boda. The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index for 2018 says South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, and Côte d’Ivoire were top four best-performing countries in Africa, while Somalia, Sierra Leone, Eritrea and Zimbabwe were at the bottom.
