Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu The government is yet to decide whether it will import four million bags of maize to cushion Kenyans from starvation, Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has said. Kiunjuri yesterday said the country is in dire need of maize after rains that were expected for the June-July harvest failed. The indecision on importing means the country could be caught up in another last-minute rush to import the produce as witnessed a year ago, leading to shortage of maize flour Kiunjuri said between January and May every year, the country imports five to six million bags of maize from other East African countries but this year, only 1.3 million bags were available from the region. “Climate change is not only happening in Kenya but across Africa. We were expecting four to five million bags from Migori and Trans Nzoia but we are not going to get even two million,” he said. The CS urged Kenyans not to politicise maize importation. Addressing the press on the sidelines of the third Inter-Governmental Forum in Mombasa, Kiunjuri said Kenya always has a shortage of 19 million bags for human and animal consumption every year. He, however, said there is hope for a lasting solution following the unveiling of the Agriculture Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy, which includes development of soil maps.
