Fast rising gospel singer Cooper Cooper has come out to explain why he left TNC Music, the label that weaned him. TNC Music, which is owned by Groove Awards winner Ljay Masai has been the home for Cooper and other artistes, who have been mentored by Ljay. “ It has been years of learning and being patient. I know most of you all know that am no longer working with Ljay Maasai’s company after my contract coming to an end, I have been patient all through beside the thick and thin within the purported timeline. It hasn’t been easy but all in all I want to sincerely thank Ljay Maasai for helping me grow musically,” he told Spice via phone. Under TNC Music, Cooper released a number of songs which got media rotation, especially his collabo with Kush Tracey, Wolova. Cooper who has since released a new jam dubbed Honourable, is keen to grow his brand after leaving the wings of Ljay. “ I could have extended the contract, but I decided to move out so that I can grow on a personal level and also as an artiste. I think it will also create room for LJay to get another artiste to groom,” he added.
