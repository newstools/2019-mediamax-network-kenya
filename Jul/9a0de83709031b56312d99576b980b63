Members of the National Assembly now want the Auditor General Edward Ouko to conduct a special audit on the money illegally incurred by the leadership of the Senate. In particular, the MPs want Ouko to determine how much money the offices of Majority and Minority leadership in the Senate have so far spent. The move comes after Leader of Majority in the National Assembly Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi told Speaker Justin Muturi that they would be writing to him as well as Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Ouko claiming Senate had taken over their mandate. “We are writing to the Auditor General and Attorney General over why PSC has created offices in the Senate outside the Constitution that has continuously been funded by the taxpayer,” he said. Duale made the remarks even as he accused the Senate of forming committees to duplicate the work of the National Assembly. He wondered why the Senate has gone on to establish and cause the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) to facilitate the offices, which he says are unknown to the Constitution and any other laws of Kenya. Duale said his argument is based on the fact that Article 108 of the Constitution provides that the Leader of Majority shall be the person who is the Leader in the National Assembly of the largest party or coalition of parties and vice versa for the Leader of the Minority party.
