Kinyuru Munuhe Police are holding eight people arrested during a Saturday night raid at an illegal alcohol processing plant in Nairobi’s Dandora area. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti yesterday said police recovered 181 boxes, each containing 20 bottles of 250ml Star Spirit, 42 boxes of Blue Ice vodka, empty plastics, and KRA stickers that will be used as exhibits in court. Those arrested are Stephen Wambugu, David Chui, Salome Wanjiru, Wilikister Kemunto, John Mwangi, Daniel Maigwa, Zacharia Macharia and Peter Maina. The owner of the illegal business is yet to be arrested. Ethanol smuggling Investigators believe the owner of the illegal entreprise is linked to a bigger chain of unscrupulous traders operating across the country mostly targeting far flung areas and informal settlements. He is also linked to illegal ethanol smuggling racket. Last month, some Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and KRA officials and unscrupulous traders were mentioned in an  illegal ethanol smuggling syndicate being investigated after the seizure of four containers at the Nairobi Inland Container Depot, which were loaded with drums of ethanol disguised as foodstuff.
