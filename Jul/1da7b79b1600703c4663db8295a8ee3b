James Magayi @magayijim SportPesa Premier League (SPL) champions Gor Mahia have raided second tier outfit Nairobi Stima for two of their most prized assets. K’Ogalo have nabbed Stima’s 25 goal star Dennis Oalo and wing wizard Curtis Wekesa on four-year contracts. Oalo emerged National Super League (NSL) top scorer last season while Wekesa contributed nine goals and 15 assists from the wing as Stima staged a spirited fight for promotion that only ended in the play-offs against Posta Rangers. The duo hit K’Ogalo camp that is preparing for CECAFA Club Championships set to kick off next weekend in Rwanda. New assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo has also returned to former club Sony for two players as K’Ogalo completed the signing of five charge from the local leagues on Tuesday evening. Midfielder Tobias Otieno and right back Abdalla Shura follow Odhiambo to Gor, the former penning a one-year deal while the latter has committed to Gor for four years. In a bid to shore up the back line Gor have also roped in Nzoia Sugar centre back Elvis Ronak in anticipation of skipper Harun Shakava’s departure to rivals Wazito. The five join three youth team players promoted to senior ranks last week with the club now focused on recruiting one proven striker, most likely a foreigner.  Nineteen-year-old goalkeeper Caleb Omondi, defender Alphonce Omija and striker Samuel Osoo were promoted to join K’Ogalo’s senior rank after impressing in the previous season. Gor have already parted ways with lead striker Jacques Tuyisenge and midfielder Francis Kahata while defenders Shakava and Philemon Otieno have been angling for moves away from the club and could have their wishes granted by the team management. Wazito have tabled Sh4 million offer for Shakava who has six months left on his contract while Zambian side Zanaco and Al Hilal of Sudan also expressed interest in the defender.
