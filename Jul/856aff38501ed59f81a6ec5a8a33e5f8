The Court of Appeal yesterday quashed the death sentence imposed on an alleged violent robber, Eric Muturi, and asked Machakos Chief Magistrate to conduct fresh sentencing. Appellate Judges Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and Jamila Mohamed ruled that Muturi deserved mitigation before the trial court passes judgment. His fist appeal had been dismissed by Justices Joel Ngugi and Lillian Mutende on January 28, 2014. Muturi was found guilty of violently robbing Charles Muinde and Winifred Wamuyu on October 31, 2008 near Kasina Estate along Nairobi-Mombasa highway. He was allegedly armed with a pistol and was accompanied by accomplices during the attack. Muinde was driving towards Nairobi when he was stopped at Mlolongo by a group of six people in police attire. The two complainants were driven to Syokimau area by some of the robbers where they were robbed and abandoned. Muturi was arrested in Kisii on November 9, 2008. He  then took the police to his house in Kitengela where properties of the complainants were recovered. Wamuyu identified him at an identification parade on November 9, 2008. Meanwhile, the court acquitted Michael Kerue Wanjira, another  suspect, after ruling that “his identification by a single witness was under very difficult circumstances”.
