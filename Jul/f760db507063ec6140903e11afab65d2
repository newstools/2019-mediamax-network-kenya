Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Fifteen Kenya Power employees were yesterday interrogated by Serious Crime Unit detectives at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in connection with postpaid billing scam in which at least Sh150 billion is suspected to have been stolen. Eight other employees  are expected to report to the DCI  this  morning while 17 others will report tomorrow  and Thursday. Sixty five of those profiled junior and mid-level Kenya Power officials as principal suspects are drawn from Nairobi, eight from North Eastern and 16 from North Rift. Among those questioned yesterday were Esther Kimani, Charles Wambugu and  directors of Star Cyber Kenya Ltd and Restaurant Limited Grand Quality. Head of Investigations Bureau John Kariuki said the investigations are specific on anomalies suspected to have been committed at the power agency. “The funds were lost as a result of conspiracy between Kenya Power staff, brokers and some customers where more than 5,000 customers benefited,” Kariuki said. However, last week, Kenya Power management sought to absolve itself from blame saying internal audit was initiated after learning of the fraudulent scheme. “We have recorded statements from the first batch of those summoned. After we are done with the total 204 people, the file will be forwarded to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for review,” a senior officer privy to the probe said.
