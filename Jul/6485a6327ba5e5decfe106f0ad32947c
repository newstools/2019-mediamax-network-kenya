Irene Githinji @gitshee A Ministry of Education report launched yesterday has shown pupils from schools that frequently administered tests scored lower than counterparts who rarely do it. In the National Assessment Systems for Monitoring Learning Achievements, it emerged that Grade Three pupils who were assessed frequently scored 40.76, 51.8 and 63.1 per cent lower in Mathematics, English and Kiswahili, respectively, than those who were assessed less frequently. “These results are not surprising given the relatively high reliance on commercial exams and low support for teachers in test construction by Quality Assurance and Standards Officers,” it read. Own tests The report showed reliance on commercial exams, unlike in Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which emphasise on continuous classroom assessment of learners by teachers. However, the report showed many teachers do not use own tests to continuously monitor learning but are instead relying on past papers, zonal and commercially outsourced assessments and tests, a trend that puts to question the diagnostic value of these assessment tools. In the Early Grade Maths Assessment Midline and Endline Studies, it emerged that 16 per cent and 16.5 per cent of the teachers reported to using commercially sourced tests regularly.
