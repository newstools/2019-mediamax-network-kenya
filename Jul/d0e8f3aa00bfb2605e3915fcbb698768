Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka A Senate committee wants the implementation of the Appropriation Act 2019 signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta halted until the collapsed Division of Revenue Allocation (Dora) bill is introduced, debated and passed by both Houses of Parliament. Senate Committee on Budget and Finance said the National Assembly erred in proceeding to introduce, consider and pass the appropriation bill without the input of the Senate after the defeat of the Dora bill. The committee said the Act is not only unlawful but is also in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution cautioning that any action taken or purported to be done under it would be illegal. “In light of the foregoing, the Senate cautions any State agency or department charged with the implementation of the appropriation Act, 2019 including the National Treasury and the Controller of Budget as any action taken under the act may be unlawful,” the committee chairman Senator Mohammed Mahamud (Mandera) said in a statement on the consideration of the Division of Revenue Bill, 2019 on Thursday. The Appropriation bill was assented to by President Kenyatta last week paving the way for the utilisation of Sh1.4 trillion from the Consolidated Fund for service delivery. Out of the total sum, the National government has been allocated Sh 415 billion for development expenditure while Sh679 billion has been earmarked for recurrent expenditure. Recurrent expenditure Commissions and independent offices have been assigned Sh6.7 billion and Sh373 billion for development and recurrent expenditure respectively. “However, notwithstanding the illegality of any actions taken either by the National Assembly or the Executive, the two Houses of parliament must prioritise the introduction, consideration and passage of the Division of Revenue Bill, 2019 in order to enable counties to prepare their annual budgets in accordance with article 224 of the constitution,”  Senator Mahamud added.
