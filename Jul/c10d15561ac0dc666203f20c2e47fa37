Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has moved to court to stop the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) from searching and seizing his properties. Waititu further wants the court to order the anti-graft body to return all documents including cheque books, logbooks, title documents and other items including materials and equipment and various articles seized by EACC  on May this year. The governor through lawyer Oliver Karori claims that EACC obtained a warrant of search and seizure in the Chief Magistrate court on May 22 over alleged corruption. Warrant On June 23, EACC raided his homes at Thome and Runda estates and carried out extensive search in the house and compound and seized several documents for purposes of investigations. According to the governor, the search, conducted by the officers, was beyond what was authorised by the court and therefore, was illegal and unjustified. He says EACC has refused to return the warrant to court and the endorsement to certify the full account of the warrant’s execution and the inventory of the items seized. “Unless the court intervenes, I am apprehensive that the said orders are susceptible to further abuse by EACC to my detriment,” he said in court documents. He wants the court to prohibit EACC from conducting future searches and seizures in his home saying the search warrants given to the EACC were illegal as the offences and crimes were not particularised in the warrants. According to Waititu, EACC was on a fishing expedition in which it carried an intrusive and invasive exploratory rummaging of his personal belongings.
