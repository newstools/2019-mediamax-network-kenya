Best moment on stage? Before Recapp group (which I was a member) broke up, we had a concert in 2018. The concert was dubbed Road To Ambition and it was amazing performing because to me, it was a dream come true. Worst public experience? Being booed by an audience until we had to leave the stage. I won’t go into the details, but most of the audience was intoxicated. That doesn’t make it any better. Best hobby? I absolutely love singing and listening to music. I eat, breathe and live music. Worst habit? I binge watch series a lot, but it is something I am working on. Best food? I can eat ugali, beef, spinach or sukuma, with avocado and a cold glass of milk everyday. Most outstanding piece of advice you have ever received I was once advised not to talk about feminism. Generally, whoever was advising me did not want me to align myself just to feminism alone. Best thing about being an artiste? It’s my lifestyle and I get to do what I love without apologies and get to be myself while at it. That is besides the fact that I studied law. Best prank you’ve played on anyone so far Back in campus, my two friends and I crept out of a broken window in class to prank our friend. It was at night and we went on and started talking to her from outside. She was freaked out and scared stiff! She later forgave us, but we laughed about it for almost two hours. Worst place you have been to and why? It’s not the worst I have visited, but I don’t think I can survive living at Coast. Though it’s a great place to visit, humidity and heat are just unbearable for me. If you were to come back as a fruit, what would it be? An avocado ya mafuta (laughs).
