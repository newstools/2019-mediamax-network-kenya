Cairo, Sunday Madagascar continued their fairy tale run in the Africa Cup of Nations following a 4-2 post match penalties win over DR Congo in the last 16 yesterday. After an entertaining 2-2 draw in regulation time, the match was forced into extra time after which a stalemate led to the shoot-outs. Madagascar scored all their four penalties while DRC missed two, the final one from Everton winger Yannick Bolasie. Meanwhile, coach Ibrahim Kamara said his Ivory Coast side would be on their guard going into Monday’s last-16 encounter with Mali after a string of surprise results in this year’s Africa Cup of Nations. The two countries share 62nd place in the world rankings, suggesting the teams are evenly matched, although the Ivorian squad appears stronger than that of their upcoming opponents. “Nobody thought that Benin could go past Morocco, the same goes for South Africa. So these are indeed messages sent to all the teams,” Kamara said Sunday, following the shock exits of hosts Egypt and Herve Renard’s Morocco. Mali are seeking a first victory over their fellow west Africans at the Cup of Nations after three losses and a draw. -AFP
