@manuel_ntoyai Plans are underway to reopen the Candy n Candy recording studios, but not in Kenya. According to the company’s boss Joe Kariuki, despite making its name through entertainment, his company is currently focussing on hospitality and agribusiness. “ We shut down because of the problems we faced as a company in terms of operations. However, that does not mean that we won’t get back to recording music, but it will be done at Arusha where we are setting up our new headquarters,” he told Spice. At the same time, the flamboyant businessman has called out on his friends in Kenya whom he called fake, for not visiting him when he was jailed in TZ. “ I used to have many friends around me, and I now can say they are fake ones since none of them came to see me while I was jailed. At jail, I underwent three surgeries on my stomach and currently healing, so I am not moving a lot,” he added.
