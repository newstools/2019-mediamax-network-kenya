Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi A Rwandan woman was yesterday sentenced to two years in prison by an Eldoret High Court for killing her husband. This is after Justice Hellen Omondi reduced the murder charge facing Rutundika Nadia to manslaughter. Nadia, a mother of one child was found guilty of strangling her husband Abbas Abdi following a long-standing domestic feud. Crime committed She committed the crime on January 19, last year at their Maili Nne estate house on the outskirts of Eldoret town, Uasin Gishu county. The deceased married the accused person four years ago after his first wife died leaving him with three boys. In her ruling, Justice Omondi said the accused did not intend to kill her husband during a quarrel that turned  violent  in their house from account of her mitigation. “The accused is a first offender, a mother of one child of tender age and has demonstrated remorse considering that she has been in custody for almost two years. I hereby sentence her to two years in jail,” ruled Omondi. While describing the accused’s action as crime of passion, Omondi said Nadia was forced to act in the manner she did after her husband told her that he would marry a second wife whether she likes it or not. “The accused  has been having frequent fights with her husband over his extramarital affairs that eventually resulted to the murder,” said Omondi.
