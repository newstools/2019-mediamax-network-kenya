Parents have no reason to worry over the content of Walt Disney’s Frozen 2 and Beauty and The Beast films, which have raised alarm over gay content allegations. Addressing journalists yesterday, Kenya Film and Classification Board CEO Ezekiel Mutua said the board has reviewed trailers for Frozen 2, a sequel from Frozen One and did not find any gay content. “Our attention has been drawn to allegations by the public through various platforms of media that Disney is showing gay themed cartoons in the country. The board has reviewed the films in question and hereby clarifies that the films, namely Frozen 2 and Beauty & the Beast, have duly complied with the provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya,” he said. Pride parade Mutua was reacting to a petition by lobby group Citizen Go, which has since collected over 300,000 signatures, in a bid to stop Disney from screening the content. Part of the petition included effort to ban children from attending the Pride Parade that was held last Saturday at Disneyland Paris. “We are happy that parents are keen on such issues but the two films have been rated PG,” he said. “KFCB will remain vigilant in ensuring that our children are not at the risk of exposure to potentially harmful content and commit to working with spectrum managers, content service providers & exhibitors to ensure Cap 222 is adhered to,” he added.
