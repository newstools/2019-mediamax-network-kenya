Debutants Bandari face a litmus test in their quest to qualify for the last eight of the ongoing 2019 Cecafa Kagame Cup in Rwanda. To qualify from Group B, Bandari must get a result against title-holders Azam when they play their final pool game this evening. The coastal club is third in the group with two points behind Azam and KCCA of Uganda. However, the permutations of a closely-contested Group B will see Bandari through if they beat Azam. Group leaders KCCA have four points from two matches while second-placed Azam have three. Having beaten the defending champions, KCCA are favoured to fend off bottom-placed Mukura Victory Sports of Rwanda, leaving Bandari and Azam to battle for the other slot. That leaves Bandari with a gigantic mission of beating and eliminating the defending champions to progress. A feat of that magnitude on their debut would send shock waves but they do not have a choice. They have drawn twice in the tournament; First with KCCA (1-1) and then a 2-2 draw with Mukura Victory Sports. In the two matches, Bandari took the lead before letting their guard down for the opponents to come back. Against KCCA, the Kenyan club struck after just two minutes but conceded a second half goal to share the spoils with the Ugandans. In their second game, Bandari took the lead but fell behind to two long-range strikes from Mukura Victory Sports and needed an added time goal to claim a point from a match they would have won. The team is slugging it out with the region’s best to prepare for upcoming CAF Confederation Cup where they are Kenya’s representatives. “Each game is a learning process and a very good challenge to us since every team here is a champion from their countries with massive experience in regional and continental events,” Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala said after the second game.
