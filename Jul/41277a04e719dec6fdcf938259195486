One person died while three others were injured when their vehicle rolled several times as they left the Soysambu Conservancy which was one of the spectator stages of the just concluded Safari Rally. The accident could not have come at a worst time as Kenya is seeking re-admission to the World Rally Championship (WRC) after a 18-year absence, with safety touted as the most important aspect of the Safari getting back to the global calendar. In the months running to the Safari, the Safari Rally steering committee led by Chief Executive Phineas Kimathi had called on all participants, drivers and spectators, to maintain the highest level of discipline in terms of safety. Kimathi has, however, distance the unfortunate incidence from the safari terming it a traffic accident with no association with any Safari Rally competitors, officials or marshals. “The accident happened after the rally had been completed and the sweeper car had cleared the stage. All available safety and medical resources of the rally responded to accident to offer medical assistance,’ read part of Kimathi’s statement. Happening at a time when Kenya needed to run a perfect show from Friday through to Sunday, the decision will be left to International Motorsport Federation (FIA) delegates, who hold the key to Kenya’s return to global status, led by Michelle Mouton on whether the incident could have an impact on their verdict of Kenya’s ability to run a WRC event. The FIA team was to oversee various facets of Kenya’s preparations for the return to global status, which we lost in 2002 due to concerns over safety, organization and finances. Mouton led in assessing the safety measures and is set to give a comprehensive report to the FIA Safety Commission. Sporting delegates, Timo Rautianen and Andrew Wheatly, will report on the sporting aspects of the Safari, while Cem Bonvell from Turkey will report on the medical aspects.
