Meru presenters were forced to apply all the tricks in the book to edge out their Mayian colleagues 4-2 in an entertaining friendly football match played at University of Nairobi Grounds at the weekend. The match which pitted stations owned by Mediamax Network Limited was characterised by trading of powerful shots at goal by both teams. Meru raced into a 37th minute lead through inspirational skipper Christopher Mburugu who capitalised on an error by Mayian goalkeeper to put the ball at the back of the net. Marete Muriithi then made it a two goal advantage for Meru in the 46th minute with a predatory strike before renowned comedian Nchebere added the third in the 55th minute. The hard-fighting Mayian, led by their captain James Lekishan, refused to concede the goals lying down when they reduced the arrears, thanks to Dickson Mpapale’s strike on the half hour mark. Mpapale, who is on loan from Milele, earlier missed a sitter after outwitting his markers. Mwenda Saba scored Meru’s fourth goal in the 55th minute with Mayian replying again through Kevin ‘DJ Signal’ Fitah in the 75th minute. Lekishan commended his Mayian charges for their strong character and especially given that two of them in Sammy Sang’ida and Ishmail Koita were playing while nursing injuries. “It would have been a different result altogether had all our players been fit. However, there is still a return match to inflict revenge on Meru,”  said Mburugu.
