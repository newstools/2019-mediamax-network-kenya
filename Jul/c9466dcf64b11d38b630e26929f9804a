Hillary Mageka @HillaryMageka Senators have cautioned Cabinet secretaries against snubbing invitations of House committees saying they risk being impeached or starved of salaries and other amenities. This is after National Assembly Leader of Majority and Garissa Township MP Aden Duale told Cabinet secretaries not to honour any summons from the Senate, arguing the Upper House had no jurisdiction. According to Duale, Cabinet secretaries Henry Rotich (Treasury), Raychelle Omamo (Defence) and Fred Matiang’i (Interior) should not attend any Senate invitations but should instead only heed to summons given by National Assembly committees. In yet another front in the unending war between the two Houses, Matiang’i and his Agriculture counterpart Mwangi Kiunjuri reportedly took notice of Duale’s advice on Thursday and skipped Senate committee meetings and instead sent their Chief Administrative Secretaries (CASs). Invitations Matiang’i was to appear before the Committee on Security, Defence and Foreign Relations while Kiunjuri was to attend Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries to answer to queries raised by members. But angry Senate led by its Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki has dared any Cabinet secretary “who wants to test the strength of the Constitution of Kenya” to defy their invitations. “I dare any State officer who is courageous enough to defy this House on the advice of some stranger or fellow out there. Try what this House can do, and we will deal with them,” he said. He said the Senate is not a non-governmental organisation, but a State organ that is duly established by 2010 Constitution. “We are not involved in some charity or philanthropic activities around town,” he said. He advised any committee chairman facing any challenge securing compliance from the CSs to notify his office for action.
