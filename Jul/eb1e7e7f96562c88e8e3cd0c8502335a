Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The Institute for Social Accountability (Tisa) national coordinator Wanjiru Gikonyo has sued the government for passing and assenting the Appropriation Bill 2019 without incorporating Division of Revenue Bill. She wants the court to bar Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich from implementing the Appropriation Act, terming it unconstitutional. “Section 39 of the Public Finance Management Act 2012 provides that the National Assembly shall consider the national budget estimates in accordance with the Division of Revenue Act,” Gikonyo says in court documents. She has named the Attorney General, Treasury CS, Controller of Budget and the National Assembly as respondents in the suit. Council of Governors, Commission on Revenue Allocation, Kenya Human Rights Commission, Africa Center for Open Governance and Transparency International, Kenya have been enlisted as interested parties. The Appropriations Act permits the government to access public funds for the 2019/20 financial year. Gikonyo, through lawyer Ngunjiri Nderitu, argued that the bill was not been agreed on and duly passed by the two Houses of Parliament as required. Final version She says the bill was referred to a mediation committee which was unable to agree on the final version of the Division of Revenue Bill 2019 within the 30-day period. Consequently, she argues, the passage and the subsequent assent of the Appropriation Bill in the absence of the Division of Revenue Act was unlawful and any action done under the Appropriation Act is therefore unlawful. “It undermines the national values and principles to uphold the rule of law and contravenes the public finance principles which is to ensure that revenue raised nationally shall be shared equitably among the national and the county governments,” reads the court documents. The government expenditure could grind to a halt if Gikonyo’s petition is successful.
