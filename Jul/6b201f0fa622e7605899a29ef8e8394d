Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Starehe MP Charles Njagua was yesterday charged with incitement to violence. Njagua, who has been in police custody since June 26, appeared before Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi and denied the charge. According to the charge sheet, he made utterances intended to incite Kenyans against foreign nationals on June 24 at Nyamakima within Nairobi county. His lawyers, Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata, Duncan Okatch and Charles Ongoto asked the court to release him on favourable cash bail saying he has been in custody for more than five days. “We ask the court to release him on minimal and reasonable terms or even free bond as he won’t abscond because he is an MP,” Ongoto told the court. Kang’ata told the court that Njagua was only facing one charge and he did not resist arrest when he was arrested. Magistrate Andayi released him on Sh500,000 bond with a surety of a similar amount or a cash bail of Sh500,000. He said Njagua is an MP, who is alleged to have said the alleged utterances and if proved to be true they can mean very bad for him and the penalty is five years imprisonment. Andayi said immigration issues are complex, Njagua being an MP he should use the right channel. The matter will be mentioned on July 17.
