Mukalo Kwayera @kwayeram Focus has now turned to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) following completion of investigations into circumstances under which the construction of a state-of-the-art mall in Kisumu by the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA), had the cost inflated by more than Sh2 billion from original estimates. For the better part of this year, detective from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) have been seeking to ascertain what role, if any, top State officials played in the transaction, that led to the cost of the five-storey shopping complex rising from Sh2.5 billion to Sh4.2 billion. EACC estimates that upwards of Sh2 billion may have been skimmed off through inflated costs in the construction of the magnificent shopping complex.  Among the nearly 100 individuals of interest to EACC are Cabinet Secretaries. Scrutinise file Yesterday, People Daily established that EACC sleuths who have been probing the matter, have finalised their inquiry whose findings have since been forwarded to the DPP Noordin Haji who is expected to pronounce himself on the matter after scrutinising the file. EACC spokesman Yassin Amaro said detectives had finished their brief and forwarded their conclusions to Haji. While not committing himself to the nature of prescription EACC had handed to the DPP, Amarro said it was now entirely upon the DPP office to decide on the way forward as it was the one constitutionally vested with prosecutorial powers. “Files are now with the DPP. We have to wait for a response from there. If the DPP gives us consent to arrest then we shall move in and abide by the recommendations. As of now, I cannot comment on how the matter will proceed from here,” Amaro said.
