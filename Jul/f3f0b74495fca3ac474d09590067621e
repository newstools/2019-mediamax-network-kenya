Suez, Monday @PeopleSport11 Arsenal transfer target Wilfried Zaha scored the winner as Ivory Coast beat Mali 1-0 at Suez Stadium on Monday evening to reach last eight of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. After huffing and puffing for most of the game, the Crystal Palace winger came up with the goods with 14 minutes remaining as he slotted home what turned out to be the winner. In four previous meetings at the Afcon finals, the Eagles have never had the better of the Elephants, with three defeats and one draw and Mali coach Mohamed Magassouba’s hopes of ending that poor run was not to be. Mali were aspiring to make the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time since 2013 when they eventually finished third. Their best ever finish was in 1972 when they ended second. However, it is now the Ivorians, winners in 2015, who will proceed to the quarter-final for a juicy match against Algeria. Meanwhile, Egypt’s usually tame press did not hold back after the national team’s exit from theAfrica Cup of Nations on home soil, branding the side “embarrassing” after a “still-born performance”. The record seven-time champions were dumped out in the last 16 by South Africa on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at the Cairo International Stadium. “You embarrassed us… Our national squad disappoints millions and bows out of the African Cup of Nations,” Al-Akhbar, one of Egypt’s main newspapers, splashed on its Sunday front page. In a country where the press is rarely critical of official institutions, there was plenty of blame thrown around. Al-Akhbar lambasted “the absurdities” of Mexican coach Javier Aguirre’s tactics and “the still born performance of the players”. A photo of star forward Mohamed Salah on the verge of tears accompanied the front-page article. Meanwhile, state mouthpiece Al Ahram declared the loss as “one of the biggest surprises of the 2019 AFCON”. -AFP
