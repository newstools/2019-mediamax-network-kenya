The embattled Kiambu Finance Chief Officer, Faith Njeri Harrison has been moved to the trade docket. A letter issued on Tuesday evening by the governor Ferdinand Waititu said the change takes effect immediately. “Pursuant to section 45(5) of the county government Act of 2012, you have been re-assigned from the office of the chief officer – Finance and Economic Planning to the office of the chief officer, Department of Trade, Tourism and Cooperatives and Enterprise Development,” said the   letter dated July 1 and signed by the governor. Njeri is alleged to be at loggerhead with Governor Waititu over claims of insubordination and sabotage. She was accused of failing to prioritise or pay crucial and important county bills consequently exposing the county to dire consequences. It is also alleged that County employees have borne the brunt of Njeri’s incompetence, which has resulted in delayed salaries. Further, county workers have not received their allowances for over six months, with pleas by the governor several months that they are paid immediately falling on deaf ears. She has been accused bribing the MCAs a certain amount of money in bid to impeach governor Waititu. The redeployment comes few days after she was reassigned to the same Trade and tourism docket in a similar Chief Officer position but was re-instated under unclear circumstances. On Wednesday 24th April, Njeri and her driver Harrison Kung’u were arrested and later charged at Kibera Law Courts for allegedly being in possession of fake US dollars amounting to Sh67,000. They were nabbed along Mpaka Road in Nairobi while driving a double cabin car with GK number plates and not county government registration. They were later booked at Capitol Hill Police Station and later arraigned in court and released on bail.
