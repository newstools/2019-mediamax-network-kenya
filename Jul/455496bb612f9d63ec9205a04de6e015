Lewis Njoka @LewisNjoka All government agencies and parastatals will beginning this financial year be expected to buy locally assembled vehicles and motorbikes from a list of 50 locally-made products. Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said the products will have been approved by the National Development Implementation Technical Committee. “Any government official who flouts this directive, meant to support the manufacturing pillar of the Big Four agenda, will be penalised,” he warned. Kibicho was speaking at Harambee House, Nairobi, during the inspection of locally assembled cars displayed by respective assemblers. The directive follows the one President Uhuru Kenyatta gave in March this year that all ministries and State agencies buy locally assembled cars. Kibicho said the committee, comprising principal secretaries from all ministries, had been looking at initiatives key to the government’s Big Four agenda and had decided to focus on those that were key to job creation.
