Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Two constitutional commissions are on the spot over irregular payment of allowances to MPs and commissioners. The Privatisation Commission is being queried over irregular payment of Sh5 million to legislators for attending a stakeholders conference in Kisumu last year while the Commission on Revenue Authority (CRA) is accused of making irregular Sh1.4 million payments for airtime allowances to commissioners and employees. In a report tabled in the National Assembly, Auditor General Edward Ouko termed the payments irregular and unjustifiable. Ouko said the Privatisation body’s payments are contrary to the Office of the President Circular of November 2017, which says allowances payable to MPs when they are invited or involved by ministries, departments and agencies should be catered for by Parliament. On CRA’s  Sh1.4 million expenditure, Ouko said each commissioner and chief executive was paid Sh29,000 per month contrary to the July 2017 gazette notice that says State officers should be paid allowances at the rate of Sh15,000 per month. CRA communications manager Oliver Mwenda, however, said the officers have since paid back the extra money.
