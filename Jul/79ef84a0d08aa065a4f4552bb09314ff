Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Police informer Peter Ngugi Kamau alias Brown in the murder case of lawyer Willy Kimani (pictured) and two others fired his lawyer, Nelias Mucera Kinyori. Kamau wants the State to appoint for him a male lawyer saying he does not want to be represented by a woman. “I want a good lawyer …a man like lawyer Nyaberi,” he told the court. Kinyori withdrew her services saying it was the right of the accused person to have another lawyer. “It is unfortunate that this case might derail and I wish him the best with the new lawyer who will be allocated to him,” she said. She told the court that she had not discussed the matter with Ngugi and only learnt about it in the morning. Justice Jessie Lessit noted that there is a committee which sits and decides on which lawyer he will be assigned but she will indicate to them that he needs a male lawyer. Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Mutuku requested that the process be conducted quickly for the case to proceed. The case will now be mentioned on July 24 for further directions.
