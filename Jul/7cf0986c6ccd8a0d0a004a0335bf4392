Emmanuel Masinde @PeopleSport11 World and Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto hopes to get full recovery from a foot injury before next leg of the IAAF Diamond League in July. The multiple world champion said that he has experienced a steady recovery from the injury which has put him out of the international circuit scene since the beginning of the track and field season. “I hope to recover well soon so that I can go back to competition. As you know, I had a foot injury which has made me not to compete in any major races but am hoping by the time we reach the next IAAF Diamond League leg, by then I would have tested myself in other races,” said Kipruto. The Commonwealth Games gold medallist could not reveal which race he will use to gauge his fitness but assured he will be ready before world championships slated for September in Doha. “Before the Monaco Diamond League, I will be running in other races to gauge myself and the fitness to see if I have recovered fully but I am not sure which race I will be taking part in,” said Kipruto. Kipruto has to liaise with his management to find out which races can be used to measure up his fitness level and body condition ahead of his return to the track. The world champion in London in 2017 Kipruto said that he is in good shape physically but he still wants to work hard and train well to come back to a competitive regime.
