Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi The implementation of the Sh65 billion construction of  Arror and Kimwarer multi-purpose dams hangs in balance after families on nearly all the gazetted land earmarked for the projects vowed not to move until compensated. Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has asked landowners to stay put until they are fully compensated by the government. He told some of the families who were planning to uproot their maize crops and demolish their houses ahead of eviction exercise to pave way for the implementation of the project by a regional authority to halt the move. Speaking in Iten town, Tolgos accused the government of duping the affected families to surrender their land and yet it was not prepared to resettle them on alternative land.
