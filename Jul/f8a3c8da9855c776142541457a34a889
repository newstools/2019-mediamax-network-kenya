Ford Kenya leadership has urged the government to ensure unemployed youths are given priority to serve as enumerators in the forthcoming National Census. Party leader Moses Wetang’ula and secretary general Eseli Simiyu  said it is regrettable that the recruitment process has been opaque and marred with irregularities. Speaking at the party headquarters, Wetang’ula said the census process was delicate exercise which requires total confidence and approval from all Kenyans. “It is unfortunate that as recruitment for the census is on so employed individuals have taken leave to participate in the exercise yet we have several educated and jobless youths who can take up the jobs,” he said. “The enumerators must also be locals known to the residents. You just don’t pick anyone from other areas and plant them in the villages.” Recruitment Wetang’ula’s sentiments come amid complaints by a section of residents in Busia and Bungoma over the manner in which the recruitment exercise is being undertaken with allegations of teachers and other government officials getting priority. The Bungoma senator rallied Kenyans across the country to ensure every individual is counted during the census set to start next month. “This exercise is very dear to the future of this country. The results will inform the government on development needs and so we should not leave anyone behind,” he said. Youths across the country have been calling on the Jubilee administration to ensure the jobless are given priority during recruitment.
