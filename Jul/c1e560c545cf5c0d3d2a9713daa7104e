Barry Silah @ObelBarry Preparations are in high gear for the International Federation of Purchasing and Supply Management (IFPSM) World Summit 2019 in Mombasa. The three-day summit, to run from September 10 to 13, will attract at least 500 local and international professionals. Participants at the IFPSM Summit, themed Sustainable Procurement and Supply Chain Practices for the 21st Century; will get insights on how to improve the performance of individual practitioners within global supply chains. The presentations delivered by industry and academic experts touch on trends and future developments in practice standards as well as opportunities. Global community Kenya Institute of Supplies Management (KISM), which will host the summit, stands to be a huge beneficiary. “Playing host to IFPSM shows that the global community has bestowed trust and faith in us to deliver a successful event. In a sense the country has been placed at the centre of conversations about how to contribute to the development of procurement and supply chain practices at a global level,” said the KISM chairman Chris Oanda during the World Summit Launch at Sarova Stanley Hotel yesterday. During the three-day programme, delegates will discuss ways of improving the industry and keeping up high standards. IFPSM as currently constituted has a membership of 250,000 globally covering 45 countries across Europe, Asia and Africa and KISM alone contributes approximately 4,000 professionals to this community.
