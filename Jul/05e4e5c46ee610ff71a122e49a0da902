Nairobi, Monday @PeopleSport11 Some Kariobangi Sharks FC players could be on their way to Goodison Park for trials after Everton manager Marco Silva admitted he was impressed by the Kenyan outfit following their international friendly match played at Kasarani Stadium on Sunday. The hosts took the honours 4-3 on post-match penalties after a 1-1 draw in normal time with both sides putting up a committed display to thrill the over 64,000 record fans who thronged the Kenyan football cathedral. “The match was competitive. I was impressed with our opponents. I’m going to sit down and analyse the video to see if there is something good that might come out, may be a Sharks player worth signing,” Silva told SportPesa News. The Blues manager lamented that injuries disrupted their performance in the first half which ultimately slowed them down but they picked up after the break to equalise. His opposite number, William Muluya attributed Sharks performance to the power of the 12th man after local supporters, who sold out the country’s biggest sporting facility, lifted them as his team marked the largest crowd it has ever played in front of in its history. “I want to thank Kenyans for inspiring us. They supported us and we are happy to have returned the kind gesture with victory,” he underlined. Muluya emphasised said they had adequate preparation ahead of the encounter and that victory indicated they are ready for the new SportPesa Premier League season. He has already signed few young talented players ahead of the season among them Patrick Otieno who he praised for having added depth in his squad during their clash with the nine-time English league champions. -SPORTPESA NEWS
