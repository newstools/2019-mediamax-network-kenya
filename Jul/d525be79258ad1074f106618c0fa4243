Derrick Otieno and PSCU @PeopleDailyKe Kenyans yesterday paid glowing tribute to fallen football icon, Joseph(Joe) Kadenge describing him as a talented footballer and a true ambassador of the game. Kadenge, who died aged 84, will be remembered for his football prowess on the pitch taking on defenders from opposing sides with gusto and earning himself a name in the country’s sporting history. President Uhuru Kenyatta described Kadenge as a sports legend and a sublime footballer who applied his talent fully in the service of his country. In a message of condolence and comfort to the family, friends and relatives of the football legend, the President said Kadenge was an icon of Kenyan football. “Joe Kadenge represented the best of our football. He was the icon of the sport in our country. It is sad that the hand of death has robbed us of a man who gave his all for the glory of our country,” said Uhuru. Kadenge, who has been ailing since 2006, is arguably the best striker Kenya has ever produced.  The famous term ‘Kadenge na mpira’ was coined by football commentators to honour his great exploits on the field during his hey day. Two years ago, the President and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta visited Kadenge at his Mariakani Estate home in Nairobi. Kadenge played for the national football team, Harambee Stars, for 14 years starting in the 1960s.  Later, he went into football management and in 2002, be became the coach of Harambee Stars. Deputy President William Ruto said Kadenge was not only a prolific player but also raised a generation of great footballers. Former prime minister Raila Odinga said: “We have lost one of the greatest talents to ever grace a football pitch in our national uniform. Joe Kadenge was a true ambassador for the country and Kenyan soccer. May he rest in eternal bliss. May his spirit inspire more young people to pursue the game.”
