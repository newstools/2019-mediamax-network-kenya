Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal is once again on the spot for allegedly failing to recover more than Sh55 million advanced to his 10  former County Executive Committee (CECs) members as car loans and mortgages. In the latest audit report by Auditor General Edward Ouko, the county boss is  accused of not establishing mechanisms to reclaim the money given to his former staff. The CECs have since exited the county government. “Available records indicate that the former CECs and staff, who were issued with loans amounting to Sh59,000,000 defaulted in repayment soon after they were advanced the loans,” Ouko says in his report on Samburu County Executive Car loan and Mortgage scheme fund for the year ended June 30, 2018. Similarly, Ouko has questioned the use of Sh41,030,884 advanced by Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi as bursaries and scholarships. In his report, the auditors say although the monies were spent, no single material was made available to show acknowledgement letters or receipts from the beneficiary institutions.
