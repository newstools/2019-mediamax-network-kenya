Bakken Bears’ and national basketball men’s team forward Tyler Okari received a worthy birthday gift as he was yesterday feted as the StarTimes Sports Personality of the month of June. His recognition follows a stellar performance at the FIBA Africa Zone Five championship held in Uganda last year where he was voted the competition’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) as the national team, Morans, won her maiden Zone Five title. “This award comes as a pleasant surprise and I am grateful. This would have not been possible without my team mates and the recognition for what we do on the court is encouraging,” said Okari. Okari’s basketball journey can be traced back to Eldoret town where, alongside his elder brother James ‘Tyson’ Ongwae, he fell in love with the sport and took it seriously after joining Friends School Kamusinga. “We had good coaches in high school who helped many of us build careers around basketball. They mentored me and developed my skills further.  Having my elder brother in the same school team and playing in the national school games helped build my confidence,” he said. He landed a scholarship that enabled him play in the NCAA Division One basketball for four seasons, spending his last two seasons with University of Louisiana Monroe where he was a standout player.
