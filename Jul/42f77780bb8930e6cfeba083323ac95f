Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has dared Senator Susan Kihika to a political duel as the row over the bid to turn Nakuru town into a city intensified. Speaking yesterday, just hours after Kihika led some local politicians in rejecting a proposal that would see the town attain city status,  Kinyanjui said he would not be distracted by “cheap politics”. The governor warned detractors not to mistake his silence for cowardice. “I’m surprised that some of our leaders, who should be in the forefront to make it (the process) even better and faster are the ones saying we’re not ready for city status,” he said. In a memorandum presented before the John Kitilit ad hoc committee on Monday, Kihika called for the suspension of the elevation of Nakuru town to a city for at least 10 years to allow for adequate plans to be put in place. However,  Kinyanjui said his administration was in the process of addressing issues— such as waste management— raised in the memorandum, also signed by MPs Samuel Arama, David Gikaria and Kimani Ngunjiri. The MPs said the town’s solid waste management and drainage system needed a total overhaul, adding that plans to make Nakuru a city can wait for at least 10 years.cuptus.
