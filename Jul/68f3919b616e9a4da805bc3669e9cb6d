Football legend Joe Kadenge passed on Sunday morning while undergoing treatment at The Nairobi Hospital. Revered for his trickery and goal-scoring heroics, Kadenge enjoyed cult-like status in Kenya in both Harambee Stars and AFC Leopards football teams between the 1950s and 70s. The 84-year-old has been battling diabetes in and out of hospital for a long time.
