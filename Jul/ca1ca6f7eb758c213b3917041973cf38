Cairo, Tuesdday @PeopleSports11 Senegal coach Aliou Cisse anticipates a tough clash when his side take on Uganda Cranes in the round of 16 fixture. The two teams finished second in their respective groups and will face off on Friday night at the Cairo International stadium. “No one should take the Ugandan team for granted and I will tell my players that because facing them is not an easy task,” Cisse told the press after his side won 3-0 against Kenya. “We need to make sure we prepare well to face Uganda because they have showed since the tournament started that they are here for a serious mission,” added Cisse. “Now it’s direct elimination, it will be hard, the Ugandan team are the team who have lost the least in the last few years. Senegal and Uganda last met in a competitive game during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers with the Lions of Teranga winning 1-0 courtesy of Sadio Mane late goal. Meanwhile, Cranes winger Abdu Lumala says the team has to continue working as a unit to get better results at the Africa Cup of Nations finals. The attacker has been impressive for the East African side thanks to his input on the pitch. Lumala, who turns out for Syrianska FC in Sweden, is confident of a good showing and has asked the fans to continue supporting the team. “We just have to keep going, we have to push each other as we’ve played. No one thought we could go through the group stages but we showed our abilities. We played good football, we surprised many,” he told Daily Monitor. “The team is helping me to become a much better player. With everything we do, we do it as a team. We showed what we are made of as Uganda. Our fans should keep behind us even if they are back home. They need to just keep positive, not negative.”-KAWOWO
