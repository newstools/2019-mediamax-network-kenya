Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe The 23,900 Administration Police (AP) officers affected by the ongoing restructuring within the State security apparatus will formally join the Kenya Police Service at a ceremony held at the AP College, Embakasi. Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai is expected to lead a team of police commanders in the function that will lead to all the AP officers deployed to sub-county commanders posts, formerly known as OCPDs. In the reforms, over 100 AP posts and camps have been converted into police posts. In Nairobi, at least 30—including  Kawangware, and Embakasi AP camps— have been affected by the change. Undergo training Some police divisions, stations and camps have also been closed to avoid overlapping of mandates. The ongoing restructuring has also brought about some challenges such as the mandate of some senior officers given that  some AP or General Service Unit (GSU)officers have been redeployed as station commanders. The commanders are now in charge of Traffic matters in their stations and will undergo training on traffic matters. At the same time, plans are underway to change the police command offices in Nairobi. For instance, Makadara Police Division will be stationed at Buru Buru.
