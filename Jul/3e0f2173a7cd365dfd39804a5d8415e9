Fred Aminga @faminga The death of Bob Collymore, a giant who walked the corridors of the telecoms sectors, draws quite a bit of parallels with American businessman Steve Jobs of Apple Computers. Both were diagnosed with cancer at their prime ages but seemed to have been re-energised by fate, working tirelessly even as they stared death in the eye. They never gave up in what is an embodiment of passion that traversed the norm. For that, Jobs who died on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56 played a key role in the success of Apple computers and the development of the iPod, iPad and MacBook. Born in 1958, Bob Collymore who is a Guyanese-born British businessman and the immediate chief executive of the African telcom giant, Safaricom died on July 1, 2019 at the age of 61 and will be remembered for his key role in the telco and deepening of M-Pesa, and taking banking options to the unbanked millions. At a tender age, both businessmen did not live with their parents. Steven was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, whom he always considered to be his real parents while Collymore is said to have started schooling in Guyana while living with grandmother before moving to UK to join his mother in 1974.
