By Paul Muhoho The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) on Friday lost its bid to unseat Nairobi Nominated Member of County Assembly (MCA) Perpetua Mponjiwa in favour of Eve Malenya. Appellate judges Wanjiru Karanja, John Otieno-Odek and Sankale ole Kantai struck out the appeal against Mponjiwa’s victory following the decision made by High Court judge Grace Nzioka on July 17, last year. Mponjiwa, an ODM member, had applied for nomination to contest the seat for Nairobi County under the gender-top rule. She was not nominated and she filed a petition before the Nairobi Chief Magistrate’s court but it was dismissed. However, the outcome provoked her further appeal before the High Court, which succeeded. ODM and Malenya filed the appeal to the Court of Appeal. Lawyer Gordon Ogado, representing Mponjiwa, had filed a preliminary objection arguing there was no valid notice of appeal lodged before the Appellate court. Further, no grounds had been filed and the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain second appeals arising from elections of MCAs. State Counsel Magdalene Ng’etich, acting for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), supported the dismissal of the appeal. The aggrieved parties’ lawyer, opposed the preliminary objection but conceded that the court had already made a finding on the competency of such appeals.
