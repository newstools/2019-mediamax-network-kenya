Sophie Njoka and KNA @PeopleDailyKe The County Government of Tana River yesterday opened a renal unit and CT-Scan machines at Hola Referral Hospital. Previously, patients requiring specialised services would have to travel to neighbouring counties of  Kilifi, Mombasa and Garissa. The equipment was set up through a partnership between the Natinal and county governments. Governor Dhadho Godhana who said the renal unit, CT-Scan and other radiological services will significantly cut costs for residents seeking specialised treatment as well as improve health service delivery in the region. ‘‘People used to spend a lot of money to get such services in other counties and now they have no reason to travel in search of treatment,’’ he said. Godhana  said the county will establish mobile clinics to reach residents in villages and remote areas. “We are planning to launch the project once complete. The mobile clinics will also be equipped with specialised equipment,” he said.
