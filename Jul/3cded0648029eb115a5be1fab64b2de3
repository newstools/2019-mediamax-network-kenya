Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Elected leaders in North Rift have accused the Judiciary of  undermining efforts to eradicate cattle rustling and banditry in the volatile region by releasing suspects on lenient bail terms. Led by Sigor MP Peter Lochakapong, the leaders took issue with how Judiciary handles cases against suspected bandits, accused of killings and theft of livestock in Kerio Valley. They claimed nearly all suspects arrested by the police officers over past and recent killings of residents are walking free after they were released on low bail terms. Lochakapong said the suspects are now terrorising residents along the borders of West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties despite the presence of security personnel. Release bandits “We are demoralised by the Judiciary’s action to release suspected bandits,” he said during a peace meeting in Kabaldat trading centre. Marakwet East MP Bowen Kangogo accused the Judiciary of promoting cattle rustling and banditry by granting lenient bail to perpetrators of the vice. “We are appealing to the courts to impose stiff bail terms on suspects of banditry and other criminal activities,” he said. Marakwet West MP William Kisang said hardly a week passes by without reports of banditry attacks. “We cannot continue to witness killings of innocent people and livestock theft by armed bandits weekly yet no action is being taken,” he said. In the latest banditry incident last Friday, a Form Four student at Tot secondary school in Marakwet East was shot dead by bandits suspected to be from East Pokot. Thirty people from the region have reportedly been killed by bandits since January. quam facia quatem rendusdae.
