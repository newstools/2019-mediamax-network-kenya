Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe County governments must move with speed and clear all the pending debts owed to suppliers and contractors, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) has said. It said Sh10.4 billion released by National Treasury to pay creditors is expected to spur the economy and help unlock stalled businesses. President of the business lobby group, Richard Ngatia (pictured) said small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that were hit the hardest, leading to business closures and loss of jobs, require the cash to sustain themselves. “We commend the action by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month through a  presidential order to ministries, departments and agencies to settle all pending bills without audit queries by end of the last financial year ended June 30,” he added. “In our policy brief dubbed “Enhancing Commitment to Contractual Obligations by Government in Payment of Suppliers” we noted that SMEs which constitute a majority of our membership were facing the challenge of bulging pending bills.”
