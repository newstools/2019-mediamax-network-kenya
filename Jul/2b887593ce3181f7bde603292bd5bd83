Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe A police constable attached to Gigiri Police Station who went missing on June 27 has been found dead in Thika. Even as detectives claimed they were investigating the whereabouts of their colleague Constable Stephen Kairu, it took the family 19 days of relentless and agonising search before they finally found the body at Thika Level 5 Hospital on Monday evening. Ironically, the body had been taken there by three traffic officers from Ruiru Police Station who had positively identified him. Corporal Muktar, Constable Muchai and police driver Constable Aden collected the body and booked the report, Occurrence Book (OB) number 95/27/6/2019 at 8.55pm before taking the body to Thika Level 5 Hospital. Records at the hospital clearly indicated the names of the deceased officer. Police said the body was found in the middle of the road near Kahawa West’s Gulf petrol station where it is suspected to have been dumped, or hit by a dark Toyota Fielder whose driver did not stop. Mobile phones Investigations have also been launched to establish the identity of men who picked documents from the deceased’s pockets. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the officer was last seen in Ruaka when his mobile phone was last active. A day to his disappearance, the deceased called his sister Miriam Wamaitha and hinted that he wanted to confide something in her.  He, however, did not deliver the message. The incident has raised concerns on how police investigate cases of unidentified bodies and missing persons. On January 29, for example, Kasarani traffic police officers took the body of Nation Media Group employee Mildred Odira to City Mortuary. At the same time, detectives from the Kasarani DCI, domiciled in the same building, were investigating the whereabouts of Odira. Six days later, the body was found at the morgue. This is despite the fact that there are explicit laid down procedures to be followed when such bodies are found.
