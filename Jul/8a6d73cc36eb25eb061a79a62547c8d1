A dispute over ownership of 503.44 hectares of land pitting state agency, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation  (KBC) and Komarock Ranching and Building Society has resurfaced, with the latter claiming the land was fraudulently acquired. KBC has already warned members of the public not to purchase the controversial prime land located on Kangundo Road in Machakos County, even as the Society maintained it legally owns the parcel. In a caveat emptor published in a local newspaper last week, KBC said the property was for the purpose of putting up broadcast facilities. The notice “It has come to our attention that some unscrupulous individuals are claiming ownership and have gone further and subdivided and sold the same land to unsuspecting members of the public. We wish to warn members of the public that such transactions are illegal and they are engaging in them at their own risk,” the notice read in part. The notice warned that anyone who has erected fence or any other structure on the land was trespassing and is liable to prosecution. But the ranching society has dismissed the notice, terming it diversionary and misleading. “KBC have no powers at all to declare they own the land, which is a subject of a case in the High Court. We have water-tight evidence to prove the land belongs to the society and that KBC is only entitled to 23 acres, which the society has no interest in,” said Komarock society chairman, Bernard Membe.
