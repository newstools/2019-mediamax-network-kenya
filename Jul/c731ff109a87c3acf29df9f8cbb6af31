President Uhuru Kenyatta will today commission Bandari Maritime Academy at the Kilindini Port in Mombasa county. The academy, previously Bandari College, is a centre of excellence in maritime training and was established as part of ongoing reforms in the maritime transport industry in the country. “Bandari Maritime Academy will provide advanced education and training to appropriately qualified candidates, leading to the award of diplomas and certificates and other such qualifications,” read a statement to media houses by State House spokesperson Kanze Dena. Heated debate The launch comes amid heated debate on the government plan to privatise the Mombasa Ports’ second container terminal. Local MPs, Dock Workers Union and Seafarers Association have accused the government of forcibly pushing for the privatisation plan. The government had introduced in Parliament proposals to amend the Merchant Shipping Act law, through a miscellaneous amendment bill, 2019 to allow Transport CS to decide who runs the CT2, in a move that has caused friction among sector players. The launch comes amid divisions that have rocked the Seafearers Union with different factions locking horns over jobs provided by the government. Shipping principal secretary Nancy Karigithu (above), who some factions accuse of fueling the divisions, however, warned that unregistered seamen will soon not be allowed to operate.
