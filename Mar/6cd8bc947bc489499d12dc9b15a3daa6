Oliver Musembi and Mathew Ndung’u @PeopleDailyke United Nations Environment and Rotary Club International have joined hands with local organisations to clean up Athi River. During the launch of the exercise at the Fourteen Falls Tourist Resort on Saturday, Rotary Club of Nairobi Thika Road President Monica Wambui said they are committed to ensuring the river is protected from further pollution. The initiative dubbed ‘adopt a river’, is be a joint venture with the Kiambu County government, Be The Inspiration organisation, schools, colleges and the Kenya Wildlife Service. Janet Kabeberi, a Rotarian and the environment chair for District 9012, said the state of the river has serious health implications for users as well as aquatic life. “There is need to remove the hyacinth which has reduced the flow of the water, forcing hippos to migrate,” she said. She added that residents should be empowered to convert the hyacinth into commercial use by making baskets, mats or fertiliser. Thika East deputy County Commissioner Thomas ole Sankei called on residents to observe proper garbage waste disposal method to protect Fourteen Falls from further pollution. Raw effluent “It is all a matter of change of people’s behaviour. If we refrain from directing raw effluent or solid waste into our rivers, we shall live in a good and healthy environment,” he said. Director of Gorgeous Beauty College Jackline Waithera said the once attractive tourist site has become an eyesore due to the pollution.  She called on Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko to intervene. This was echoed by MCA Joachim Njama who said the county government was losing revenue whereas residents who depend on the river to eke out a living have been rendered jobless. Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, through a county representative, committed to ensure that the Fourteen Falls tourist resort is restored.
