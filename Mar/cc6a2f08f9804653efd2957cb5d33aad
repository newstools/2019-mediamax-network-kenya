Parliament now wants to censure Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge for introducing regulations that cap daily bank deposits and withdrawals at Sh1 million. The MPs accused the governor of  implementing regulations which have not been enacted by the Legislature, which, they said, has the exclusive mandate to make laws. Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo said that by “purporting to  make laws” Njoroge was treading on dangerous ground. “My proposal is that a censure motion be brought without further delay to discuss his conduct,” said Amollo. When Njoroge appeared before the National Assembly’s Committee on Finance and National Planning last month, he said implementing the amendment to Section 33C of the Banking Act on deposits and withdrawals would conflict with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions on anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism.
