One of the year’s best performing bond markets, Kenya, suffered its worst day since November on Friday, as a multi-million dollar scandal building around Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich was compounded by a bad day for riskier assets globally. A broad-based fall left the country’s longer-dated dollar-bonds that are usually favoured by international investors down almost 2 cents and more than any other African countries’ bonds though many had also seen sizable falls. Kenya’s improving economy and relative stability have made its bonds a favourite pick for investors this year who have been piling back into Africa’s high-yielding ‘frontier’ markets. Despite a run of falls this week as the concerns around the dam scandal have mounted, they remain some of the best performing bonds in the world. They have returned 12.2 per cent year-to-date according the main emerging market debt index, the JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified. That compares to 7.4 per cent year-to-date for the frontier market subset of the JP Morgan index and five per cent for the broader emerging market swathe. UBP emerging market strategist Koon Chow said the concerns around Rotich were probably part of pressure in recent days although there it was clearly also down to investors cashing in on some of the year’s gains. “Kenya was one of the biggest overweights (for investors this year) so as risk has been taken off the table, it has been beaten up.”  –REUTERS
