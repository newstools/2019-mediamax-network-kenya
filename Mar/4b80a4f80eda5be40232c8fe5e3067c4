By Steve Umidha Online construction firm iBUILD on Friday penned a deal with Kenya Engineering Technology Registration Board (KETRB) in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) expected to link registered engineering technologists and technicians with the mobile based app. iBUILD is a mobile-enabled platform that connects individuals keen to put housing structures with masses of construction-related people looking for work and facilitates open access to housing support services that guide individuals through the construction process. “The relationship with KETRB is essential in identifying those technologists that we really don’t know much about and have a limited skill set and offering them the ability to improve that skill set and to be identified. We believe we are establishing a process that will provide value for those who are unknown and encourage them to come into the market place and new gain skills to be effective in building homes for Kenyans,” said Co -Founder Lew Schulman. The Kenya Engineering Technology Registration Board (KETRB) is a statutory body mandated with regulating the practice of engineering technology professionals. “We are actually very excited that within no time we will be in a position that we can say we will have them all of them onboard. You know you can get someone who is certified, licensed who legally does your work because he is a professional recognized in Kenya.  I want to believe all of us will be winners,” Said KETRB chief executive Alice Mutai, saying the partnership will act as a way as a way of providing work to the youth. Since its launch in January over six thousand contactors, homeowners and artisans have signed up on the iBUILD platform.
