Italian Guido Migliozzi birdied the par five 12th to steer clear of a crowded leaderboard and hold on to win the Magical Kenya Open held at the par 71 Karen Country Club. The Qualifying School graduate playing his 14th European Tour event with no previous top-10n to his name played a steady round of gold staring with a four- under par 67 in the first round and followed it up with a three-under par 68 to make cut at seven under par 135. He had his best day on the course on the third round, firing his lowest round of his European Tour career at seven –under par 64 to share the lead at into the final round with playing partner Adri Arnaus. On the final round, the 22-year old carded a 69 and get to 16-under par 268, one shot clear of playing partner Arnaus and South Africans Louis de Jager and Justin Harding thus avoiding a four-player playoff. “I am delighted to be the winner. I loved playing in Kenya as I like playing under pressure, it is like a drug and I perform better while under pressure. The crowd was amazing in the last two rounds. There was a lot of pressure on the course. After the birdie at the 12th I was leading but it was tough. I just kept patient towards the end,” said Migliozzi. Migliozzi, who came to Kenya from a disappointing trip to Qatar Masters where he failed to make cut, credits the lead to help he got from last year’s winner and fellow countryman Lorenzo Gagli who lend him a 2-iron after his broke and he did not have a replacement. “Lorenzo gave me his 2-iron and that was the key to my winning. When the competition was tight, that club helped me with the tee shots,” added Migliozzi, who is headed to Malaysia for another weekend of action after his Karen win.
