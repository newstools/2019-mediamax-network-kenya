Alfred Wanjohi Kenyan music sensation, Audiphaxad Peter, who is well known as Guardian Angel, has been unveiled as the brand ambassador for Crowned Eagle Safaris. Crowned Eagle Safaris is a travel agency based in Nairobi, Kenya that plans tours and travels for clients in Africa, Europe, Dubai and Asia. Guardian Angel was unveiled at a special event at the agency’s offices at Krishna Centre, Westlands, where he was welcomed into the  Crowned Eagle Safaris family. Speaking to PD Wikendi, Guardian Angel stated that he is not only elated with the job, but also will use it to further spread his CSR activities. “When such blessings come my way, I give thanks and it also reminds me of the responsibilities that also come with it. For my fans, I will be dropping something this week, so they should also watch out for that,” says Guardian Angel. The singer who in 2017 was among Taxify Kenya’s brand influencers, expressed his excitement about the new deal. Guardian Angel is obviously having one of his best times, as this deal is coming after he won seven awards last year alone in both the local and international arenas, including the Groove Awards Artiste of the Year title.
