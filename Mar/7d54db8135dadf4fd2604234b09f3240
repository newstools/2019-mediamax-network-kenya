Bernice Mbugua @Bernice Mbugua Senior counsel Paul Muite wants Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) acting managing director Bernard Nguyo cited for contempt of court. Muite, representing OCP (K) Ltd, yesterday claimed Nguyo disobeyed orders to retest impounded fertiliser for excessive mercury. The magistrate’s court on January 15 issued orders for the retest after an application by OCP (K), former Kebs MD Charles Ongwae and nine others, who are accused of unlawfully releasing to the firm 5,846,000kg of compound fertiliser, containing mercury. The court had ordered the  retest be done on February 21 but Muite said Nguyo did not show up. Ruling on the matter will be made today.
