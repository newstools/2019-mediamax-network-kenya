The government is talking to potential investors to inject cash into the financially troubled East Africa Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) in an effort to revive the cement maker. Industrialisation Cabinet secretary Peter Munya said the giant  manufacturer which requires a bailout of Sh15 billion has the potential to stand on its feet again with quick intervention. The CS who was speaking in Kibini area of Kajiado county  said the government has already put in place strategies to revive the company and to help it keep its head above water. Munya said selling part of the company land which is in Athi River is not sufficient to generate the money required and potential investors can help in bailing out the company. He said the major turnaround planned for the company is also focused on changing the present leadership, adding that the management has totally failed due to massive corruption. The announcement by Munya comes hot on the heels of appointment of Stephen Nthei as acting managing director to replace Simon ole Nkeri who was sent on leave last month. Major challenges Excess workforce is one of the major challenges the company has been grappling with. It pays Sh200 million a month in salaries. Recently the company laid off over 620 workers who are currently demanding dues amounting to Sh1.5 billion. Munya said the company will invest in modernisation of the factory to increase productivity and improve efficiency. EAPCC chairman Edwin Kinyua  regretted that the company which  has significant economic impact is currently operating at only 50 per cent of production.
