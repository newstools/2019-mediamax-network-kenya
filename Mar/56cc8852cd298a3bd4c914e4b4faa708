Football Kenya Federation (FKF) will need at least Sh400 million and modern stadia to introduce the use of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the SportPesa Premier League, a feat that the federation boss said will not be achieved in near future. This comes in the wake of numerous complaints by teams in the league, who have questioned the levels of officiating, the most recent ones being Tusker coach Robert Matano who termed his team’s 1-0 loss to Gor Mahia as daylight robbery on Wednesday and Sofapaka president Elly Kalekwa who blamed match officials for being compromised to favour his side’s opponents Kakamega Homeboyz at the weekend in a match they tied 2-2. “I was in Istanbul, Turkey two weeks ago for the Fifa Summit, where VAR was one of the topics being talked about. For us to have it in Kenya, we need at least Sh400 million (4m dollars), because we will be needed to have a headquarters for the equipment, then ensure that all match venues are fitted by fibre optic and we broadcast all matches live,” said Mwendwa. He added: “We will also need to train the referees on how to use VAR. We cannot achieve this before 2022.” Mwendwa said clubs with reservations on specific referees should complain to match commissioners who in turn would put recommendations to the federation for investigations to commence. “We have to work in a formal manner. If we receive any complains we will investigate and come up with a solution, but at the same time if a ref has 90 percent  perfection and 10 percent miss judgement, we consider that as human erro,” he said.
