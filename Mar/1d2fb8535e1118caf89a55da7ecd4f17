Reuben Mwambingu and Natasha Waithera United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) secretary-general Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi has hit out at governments across the globe for “blowing hot and cold” on gender equality issues. Addressing the Global Women’s Voice Conference 2019 in Mombasa on Friday, Kituyi said governments, Kenya included, make promising statements on gender parity and invest resources, but fail to follow up on achievement of equality. As a result, the Unctad boss said the least affected by inequality end up benefiting the lion’s share of resources allocated to programmes meant to address the gender equation. Kituyi said: “We tend to treat people who are not equal as equal and this is why it has been difficult to solve the inequality challenge.” Meanwhile, MPs with disabilities have demanded equal representation of persons living with disabilities (PWDs) in leadership. The members of the Kenya Disabilities Parliamentary Association said PWDs, youths and marginalised communities should be given opportunities to take up leadership positions. They spoke during a retreat in Mombasa that sought to address and provide solutions to challenges faced by persons with disabilities.
