George Kebaso @Morarak The high temperatures being experienced in some parts of the country are not about to subside according to the latest Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) weather report. The national weather forecast office cautioned Kenyans to brace themselves for even hotter days as temperatures continue to rise in several parts of the country including Nairobi and Mombasa. The latest warning comes barely a week after KMD raised concerns over changing temperature patterns. However, according to the weatherman, this is not just in Kenya but globally. In the latest weather alert issued on Tuesday, KMD indicated Kenyans would experience three weeks of unusually hot weather. According to the report, this drastic change of weather is likely to be accompanied with health consequences on people not used to these extremely high temperatures. KMD deputy director Ayub Shaka said temperatures in Nairobi are expected to rise to as high as 31.90C, whereas those in Mombasa  could soar up to 350C  in the coming days.
