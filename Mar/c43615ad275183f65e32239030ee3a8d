Enock Amukhale Tension is high in Kilingili market, Vihiga county, after six night guards were killed by criminals on Saturday night. The six, who were manning shops at the market located 50 metres from the area police station, were ambushed by a gang who butchered them using pangas before stealing merchandise. A trader, Hellen Ngaira, whose night guard was killed and shop vandalised, said property of unknown value was stolen. A former Idakho South ward MCA, Ngaira blamed the security agents for laxity saying residents are living in fear of attacks. “I was informed that my shop was broken into and my night guard Thomas Lusioli killed,” she said. Vihiga senator George Khaniri asked police to move with speed and apprehend the criminals, adding that efforts must be made to beef up security in the area. “It is unfortunate that six people lost their  lives in the hands of criminals. I therefore ask police to move with speed and have the culprits arrested and prosecuted,” said Khaniri. Vihiga county deputy governor Patrick Saisi blamed police for failing to protect residents from criminals. “Police must explain why criminals can kill people yet no effort was made to deffuse the attack,” he said. Transport on Luanda-Kakamega road was paralysed in the morning when residents held demonstrations demanding audience with the area police boss. County commissioner Susan Waweru was reportedly held in a security crisis meeting but said a manhunt for the gang had been launched.
