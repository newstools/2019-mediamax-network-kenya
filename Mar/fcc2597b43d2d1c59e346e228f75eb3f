Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi The Kenya Dental Association (KDA) has criticised county governments for declining to hire trainee dentists after completing internship at their hospitals. Speaking in Eldoret town, North Rift and Western Kenya KDA chairperson Lillian Apadet said dentists are key healthcare providers, yet devolved units have failed to recognise their role in the sector. She said whenever counties call for applications for various slots, they leave out dentists, saying the trend is a major cause of concern to unemployed medical practitioners specialising in the area. “It has become a habit for county governments to overlook the area of dentists when placing adverts for slots to be filled, yet most hospitals lack dentists thereby affecting access to oral health care services,” she said. She cited Uasin Gishu county which has only one specialised dentist, noting that majority of the patients in search of dental services were suffering. The official said hospitals in rural areas were the most hit as people with dental problems were being forced to seek treatment in private hospitals or unqualified medics. “The number of people seeking treatment of oral-related ailments is increasing at an alarming rate,  yet there are  very few dentists in public hospitals in the region,” said Apodet. She said most of the public hospitals were operating with a single dentist despite increased demand for oral health services saying that the most hit are sub county hospitals. Quacks The chairperson said that 15 doctors who graduated from Moi University School of dental science last year are yet to be absorbed by the county  governments in the region. She said a similar situation is facing 40 doctors, who graduated from University of Nairobi’s School of Dental Science and challenged counties to hire them to save Kenyans from falling prey to quacks in the oral health sector.
