Mercy Mwai @PeopleDailyKe The National Assembly may delay its recess scheduled to start next week to vet President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominee for Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. Mutyambai will be jointly vetted by the National Assembly’s committee on Administration and National Security and the Senate committee on National Security, Defence and Foreign Relations. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday told MPs he will be asking the House Business Committee to propose a way forward with respect to the calendar of the House to ensure the process of approving the nominee is concluded within the timelines as set out in the law. Time lapse If the House proceeds on recess next Thursday as scheduled, by the time it resumes, the  period within which members are required to vet the nominee will have lapsed. MPs have 14 days to approve or reject a nominee. Muturi told the House the committees have until  April  2 to table their report for either approval or rejection to the House. If the period for consideration of a nominee by Parliament lapses before the House gives a verdict,  the nominee will be deemed to have been approved by the House. The Speaker said they had agreed on a joint sitting of both Houses due to time constraints and resources, requirements of the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act, 2011, the Standing Orders of both Houses and the practices of Parliament.
