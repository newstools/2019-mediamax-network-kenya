Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Ugly scenes played out yesterday at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters on Kiambu Road, Nairobi, after members of the troubled Ekeza Sacco Limited and Gakuyo Investment Club turned rowdy. The crowd disrupted the planned recording of statement by individuals who have been defrauded in the scheme. Police were forced to lobe tear gas canisters to disperse the mob even as claims emerged the chaos was organised to intentionally stop the process. “Some of those blocking the road and being unruly are not members. We want George Kinoti to investigate who they are and who sent them,” said an elderly Grace Wanjiru. Controversial televangelist-cum-businessman and politician David Ngare, owner of the investment schemes that went under, has been defensive, saying all members will be compensated in two months.
