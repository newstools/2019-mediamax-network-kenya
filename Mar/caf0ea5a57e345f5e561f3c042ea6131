Brussels, Tuesday The EU on Tuesday condemned the seven-year jail sentence imposed on a leading Iranian human rights lawyer for security offences, calling for an “immediate review” of the case. The bloc said Nasrin Sotoudeh, an award-winning rights activist, had not had a fair trial at Tehran’s Revolutionary Court and insisted her right to appeal must be respected. “The recent conviction of Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh to at least seven years’ imprisonment is a worrying development,” a spokeswoman for the European Commission said. Sotoudeh’s trial went ahead in her absence and featured “a number of other violations of the right to due process”. A judge told Iran’s semi-official ISNA news agency on Monday that Sotoudeh was given five years for “colluding against the system” and two years for “insulting the leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)”. One of Sotoudeh’s lawyers said she chose not to be represented in court because the case did not adhere to the “principles of a fair trial”.  — AFP
