Brussels, Wednesday Brexit negotiations “have been difficult” and “no solution has been identified” to the Irish backstop, the European Commission has said. It comes after the latest talks between UK ministers and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. The announcement came even as Britain prime minister Theresa May defended her record in the House of Commons during the Prime Minister’s Questions session. She issued a statement on government pledge over post-Brexit workers’ rights. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the talks had taken place in a “constructive atmosphere” but there had been no breakthrough. The UK is pushing for legally-binding changes to the EU deal. The EU-British talks are aimed at helping May’s government get the November divorce deal through parliament and avoiding Britain crashing out of the bloc on March 29 with out a deal. Schinas was speaking after Barnier briefed the European Commission’s weekly meeting on the state of Brexit talks. Speaking after talks with Barnier, the UK’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said: “Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We’re now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon.” He added: “We’re into the meat of the matter, we’ve put forward very reasonable proposals.” The backstop is an insurance policy – designed to avoid a hard border “under all circumstances” – between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to it that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit.  – BBC
