Early this week, Beating Heart label presented Artist Saronde featuring Labdi and Idd Aziz as the showcase guests at Alliance Français in Nairobi. The label, for those that are not aware, is at the forefront of African electronic sound, revising forgotten folk recordings for the global dance floor with the help of some of the world’s most innovative electronic artists. The performance kicked off at around 8pm as Idd Aziz, who is a musician and multi-instrumentalist, played some of his music. His African Sound was quite enticing to the ear, as the crowd cheered while singing along. After an hour, he was joined by Dj Chris Pedley, who is also the co-founder of the Beating Heart label. He played a smashing hyped set infusing the live performance of Idd Aziz and female vocalist Labdi. The event was, however, not as fully packed as the previous ones, but nevertheless, guests danced till the wee hours of the morning.
