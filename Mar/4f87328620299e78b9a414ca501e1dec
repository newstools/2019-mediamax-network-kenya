Eric Juma An ODM leader has warned that the party risks losing in the April 5 Ugenya parliamentary by-election because its focus has been on 2022 governor’s race. Emily Awita, a nominated MCA at Siaya County Assembly, urged ODM elected leaders, especially MPs, to stop confusing the electorate by campaigning for Senator James Orengo’s governor’s bid and instead stick to campaigns that will ensure party candidate Chris Karan captures the parliamentary seat. Speaking to People Daily in Ugenya on Friday, Awita regretted that most of the campaign rallies in the area relate to 2022 politics, which was jeopardising Karan’s re-election bid. “Our opponents are capitalising on the confusion and that may ruin our plans and efforts to have our candidate win the seat,” she said. Awita appealed to MPs and MCAs shelve other interests and support Karan. Meanwhile, Movement for Development and Growth candidate David Ochieng has been on a door-to-door campaign in the area. He claimed candidates backed by other political parties would not fulfill their duties independently. “Those backing Karan are party members, who may have interests later in CDF tenders and other projects,” he said. While speaking in Ugenya recently, ODM leader Raila Odinga instructed Orengo and Governor Cornel Rasanga to lead campaigns to ensure Karan clinches the seat. Other candidates in the by-election are Brian Omondi (Third Way Alliance) and Daniel Juma (Grand Dream Development Party ).
