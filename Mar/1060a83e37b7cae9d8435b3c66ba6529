Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi It is a relief for Nairobi lawyer Guy Spencer Elms after a court allowed Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to withdraw a criminal case against him relating to a Sh500 million piece of land in Karen. City Court Chief Magistrate Joseline Ongayo allowed the prosecution’s application to withdraw the case in which Nairobi businesswoman Agnes Kagure was the complainant, for lack of evidence. In her ruling, Ongayo said  the action of the DPP was influenced by the information in his office following a perusal of the file presented before making the application. Conflicting evidence “Even as the DPP noted they had acquired new conflicting evidence to what had been provided in court, the court could not dictate this evidence be presented before the withdrawal can be done as he was acting within his authority according to the Constitution,” she ruled. Kagure’s lawyer Wandugi Kirathe had opposed the DPP’s move to withdraw the case saying Kagure was the victim and withdrawing it would be prejudicial. According to Wandugi, the DPP does not have an open book to commence and disrupt cases arbitrarily and more so in the said case where the office had not provided proper reasons for the withdrawal application. Charges against Spencer included forging his client,  the late Roger Bryan Robson’s will. Robson died in August 2012. The lawyer was charged after Kagure went to court claiming to have bought Robson’s property in Karen in November 2011. Formal conveyance Kagure said she paid Sh100 million in cash to Robson and that through her lawyer, Michael Osundwa Sakwa, executed a formal conveyance which was registered at the Ministry of Lands. Before his death, Robson engaged Elms in 1997 to execute his will which stipulated that his estate be awarded to his English nephew in form of money and to charitable organisations in Kenya involved in environment, wildlife and education.
