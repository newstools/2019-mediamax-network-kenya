It will now be obligatory for the Kenya Power to compensate Kenyans whose electronic gadgets are destroyed due to power surge. Energy Cabinet secretary Charles Keter said the recently assented Energy Law requires the firm to pay for all the electronic apparatus destroyed as a result of power surges which have been the norm for many years. Reduced marginally “Kenyans should no longer worry over the loss of their gadgets as it is now a requirement in law they be compensated for the losses,” Keter told the Senate Energy Committee yesterday. The CS also said that electricity prices will reduce marginally this year when a majority of power-generating projects are completed. The Lake Turkana Wind power project which will increase to the national grid 300 mega watts would help in supplementing the existing power generated. Last year the cost of power was reduced marginally where users started paying fuel cost charge of Sh4.75 per unit of power a decline from Sh4.95 per unit previously charged. According to Keter, the ministry targets the charge be set at Sh2.31. Keter told the committee, chaired by Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina, that the Lake Turkana Wind Power and the government had entered into a Power Purchase Agreement, for the design, financing, procurement, construction, installation and testing.
