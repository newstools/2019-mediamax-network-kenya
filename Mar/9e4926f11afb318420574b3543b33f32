Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Fit again Harambee Stars vice captain David ‘Calabar’ Owino is back in the side after being included in a 24-man provisional squad that was named by head coach Sebastien Migne ahead of the final Africa Cup of Nations Group F qualifier against Ghana in Accra on March 22. The Zambia-based defender has been missing from the national team for a long spell, mainly because of injuries and dip in form. He was last expected to return against Ghana last September, only to pick another injury while in camp. The 30-year-old who has been a regular in the Zesco United side failed to feature in the Stars’ triumphant team against black Stars of Ghana, last September after aggravating a recurring injury while in training last August. Migne also included striker Masud Juma, from Al Nasr,Libya. The former Kariobangi Sharks striker is making a comeback to the team for the first time since the victorious Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in 2017. England-based defender David Sessay, Sweden-based midfielder, Kariobangi Sharks’ in-form striker Duke Abuya and Mathare United’s Cliff Nyakeya are the new faces in the team set for the Accra duty. Captain Victor Wanyama of English Premier League (EPL) side Tottenham Hotspurs is also included in the team after he recovered from a nagging knee injury. The team that will report to camp on March 17, has an additional five reserve players, who the former Congo Brazzaville tactician says are for precautionary measures and will remain on standby in case of any eventualities.
