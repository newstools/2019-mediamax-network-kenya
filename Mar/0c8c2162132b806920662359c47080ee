Irene Githinji @gitshee Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) yesterday asked complainants in three schemes under the leadership of David Kariuki Ngari alias Gakuyo to report to its headquarters on March 18. The request by the DCI comes in the wake of reports that Gakuyo, who is also the director of Ekeza Sacco, irregularly transferred Sh1.5 billion from the society to his real estate firm. Auditors from the Commissioner of Co-operatives said  the sacco was operated illegally. Yesterday, the DCI said in a statement it has received numerous fraud complaints touching on Gakuyo Real Estate, Ekeza Sacco and Gakuyo Investment Club, adding that investigations are underway. Those to report to the DCI’s offices are complainants from Kiambu and Nairobi while the rest of the counties will be guided in due course. They are to carry documents showing their engagement with the three schemes. Last week, Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i said police are trailing officials for misappropriation of investors funds.
