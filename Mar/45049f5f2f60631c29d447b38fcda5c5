For all we know, it is the same political class, who hide behind donations in churches for political cover,” he said. The remarks come amid revelation of corruption scandals at different ministries by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). Through the hashtag #beyondzerocorruption the group is planning a “Poor Peoples March” on April 30 to create awareness on the fight against graft. “Clearly, the political establishment has failed us thus we are rallying all citizens to stand up and be counted (in the war on graft),” said Jacob Opara (pictured), part of the group.
