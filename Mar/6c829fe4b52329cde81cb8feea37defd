TOM RACHUONYO Six villagers were Friday hacked to death after a fight erupted between two families in Nyangau village, East Kamagambo location in Rongo, Migori county. Among the dead were two primary school pupils aged 13 and 6. More that 10 other people were admitted to Rongo and Homa Bay sub-county hospitals with deep cuts inflicted by machetes and other crude weapons. Medical superintendents from the two institutions, however, declined to speak to the press on the condition of the victims.  Migori county police commander Joseph Nthenge said 30 people have been arrested in connection with the incident. He said the fracas begun after one of the families accused another of bewitching them and being behind vices in the village. “The family members got angry and started fighting and as a result, the six were hacked,” he said. Some villagers, however, blamed the police accusing them of failing to contain the situation. “If the police came here on time, then this thing would have not been as tragic. They took their time and we have lost lives,” one of the villagers, Henry Ochieng, said.
