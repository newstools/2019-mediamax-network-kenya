Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris yesterday urged the government to address the plight of social workers.  Speaking during celebrations to mark the Social Workers International Day,  she challenged both National and County governments to come up with a framework that will see  the welfare of social workers improved. “Most of these workers expose themselves to a lot of danger in their day-to-day activities. It is the high time the government appreciates them,” she said. She singled out disaster management and psychiatrist social workers as some of the workers whose welfare needs to be addressed urgently. Kenya National Association of Social Workers chair Stephen Omondi supported Passaris proposal, saying social workers having been neglected for a long time.
