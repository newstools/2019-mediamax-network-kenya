Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Detectives are probing self-proclaimed prophet David Owuor’s involvement in a case of suspected fraud involving property worth billions of shillings. At the centre of the controversy is a property said to belong to the family of Jane Muthoni but managed by Repentance and Holiness Ministry church owned by Owuor. Dove Apartments, located in upmarket Westlands, is one of the matters sleuths are investigating after allegations raised by the family that the church had taken full control of the property. Kabete DCIO Francis Wanjau said detectives had seized property documents from Dove Apartment and another property located in Riverside Drive for scrutiny. Muthoni’s family has accused the self-proclaimed prophet of allegedly pocketing millions of shillings in rent from the property, which has 14 town houses that attract rent of Sh170,000 each, amounting to Sh2.3 million per month. Bishop grilled They allege that Owuor and the church coerced Muthoni to appoint Lily Njage, a follower of the ‘prophet’, as a co-director in Shaba Investments Limited that owns and manages the property. But the church, which denied allegations that Owuor has been pocketing millions of shillings in monthly rent from the apartments, said revenue generated from the property is banked in Muthoni’s account. Police now want to trail the proceeds of the property in question, to establish the account that has been receiving rent deposits from the apartment as well as whether there have been withdrawals. Yesterday, detectives grilled Njage for several hours. A bishop from the Repentance and Holiness church admitted that Njage had been summoned to the Kabete Police Station but refused to reveal more details saying the matter was a police case. On Tuesday, some bishops from the church came out to defend their ‘prophet’ from questions posed by journalists.
