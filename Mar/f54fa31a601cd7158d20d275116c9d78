Harambee Stars has received a financial boost ahead of their participation in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations after the team entered into a partnership with gaming firm Betin. Stars received Sh20 million from the betting company with Sh5 million out of the amount going towards purchasing kits and replica jerseys while the rest will cater for the team’s preparations for the biannual Africa event slated for Egypt in June. During the unveiling of the partnership at a Nairobi hotel, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa said the funds will go a long way in supplementing the Sh250 million which the team will get from the government towards Stars’ preparations for the tournament. Mwendwa, while acknowledging the gesture by Betin, said the federation still has a huge budget which needs to be catered for if it is to successfully send Stars to Afcon as well as the national team to the 2020 Olympic Games. Not enough He hinted that the federation may unveil two or three more sponsors next week in a bid to meet the financial obligations and especially that of ensuring Stars players are well remunerated at Afcon. “What we are about to receive is barely enough and I call upon well-wishers to come on board and support national teams. The Sh250 million pledged by the government is only up to the month of July after which the federation will be on its own financially,” said Mwendwa. He added: “We are happy to be partnering with Betin who have come on board in the nick of time but in the event the team reaches the final and eventually wins the cup, we will be talking about increased bonuses to the team,” said Mwendwa who revealed that the Sh250 million from government will be used to offset the expenses dating back from the Afcon qualifying campaign. A three-week camp has also been lined up in France, in May, before Stars head to Egypt for the continental assignment.
