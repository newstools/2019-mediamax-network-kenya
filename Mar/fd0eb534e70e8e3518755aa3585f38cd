Mercy Salisi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi County Assembly has rejected nomination of Sonia Birdi as Environment executive, over “her temperament and poor knowledge of environmental issues.” Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had nominated Birdi  a former nominated  MP to head of the Environment docket and subsequently appeared before the Assembly’s appointment committee for vetting last week. Majority Leader Abdi Guyo, who tabled the committee’s report yesterday said they were satisfied by qualifications presented by successful nominees for other dockets but did not approve the Environment nominee. Altercation with police The committee said  Sonia was hostile and arrogant hence unfit to hold a public office.  Birdi made headlines for wrong reasons when she was involved in an altercation with traffic police officers manning Gilgil weigh bridge. She had attempted to release a truck that had been impounded by the officers. Acting County Secretary Pauline Kahiga has been approved and takes up the role of Public Service Management director.  Lucia Mulwa has been approved for Gender post while  Winfred Gathangu has been confirmed for the position of Finance and Economic Planning.
