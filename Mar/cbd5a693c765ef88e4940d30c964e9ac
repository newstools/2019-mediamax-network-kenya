A family in Kipkelion, Kericho county, is yet to come to terms with the loss of a son in the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash, 19 years after it lost another in a similar accident in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. Yesterday, Selina Keter was recuperating at Siloam Hospital in Kericho where she was taken for treatment after she collapsed upon receiving the news of the death of her last born son, Kipng’etich Rogony. Keter had lost another son, Richard Rogony, in the Kenya Airways flight which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Côte d’Ivoire killing all 179 people on board on January 30, 2000. Richard was part of the Kenya Airways crew in the doomed flight while Kipng’etich, 32, was returning home  from an assignment in Ethiopia last week. Medical engineer Kericho Agriculture CEC Philip Mason, who is an elder brother to the deceased, said the family was yet to come to terms with the news. He said his brother, a medical engineer, had gone to Ethiopia to oversee installation of medical equipment. “This is shocking to the family because our brothers died in plane crashes exactly five minutes after takeoff. We are yet to come to terms with the tragedy,” said Mason. Huge gap He said Kipng’etich had called a nephew in Nakuru to tell him that he was returning to Kenya at around 11am and asked him to pick him at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The reunion was not to be. Mason described Kipng’etich, a father of a three-year-old girl, as a hardworking, go-getter who was  dependable and generous. “He was a generous person and many people depended on him. The gap he has left will be hard to fill. The whole village is mourning our brother with us,” said Mason. Kipng’etich attended Taitta Towett Secondary School and Technical University of Mombasa where he studied Biomedical Engineering. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony sent a message of condolences to the family.
