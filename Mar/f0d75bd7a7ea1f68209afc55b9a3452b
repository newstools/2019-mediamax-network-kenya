Deputy President William Ruto yesterday dared his critics to produce evidence implicating him in graft instead of engaging in a smear campaign. He said his commitment to rid the country of the corruption is beyond reproach and cautioned those who want to use a noble cause to taint his name and settle political scores. Ruto, who spoke in the presence of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka in Murang’a during the burial of Senator Irungu Kang’ata’s mother,  said the Jubilee government is committed to eradicating graft. “We want all corruption allegations to be proven on basis of accuracy and solid evidence and not spreading mere propaganda,” he said. Support Uhuru The DP said some leaders who want to paint government in bad light are insinuating that no work is being done. He said leaders who want to genuinely support  President Uhuru Kenyatta to achieve his legacy should join hands in making graft fight a success. Ruto also sought to answer his critics who have been questioning his interest in dams saying they are part of the Jubilee manifesto and he has to make sure they are done. “Yes, I have interest because they make part of our development agenda which we had promised to deliver to our people, but beside that I have not other attachment,” he added. His pronouncement came after more than 20 legislators and a governor backed the ongoing purge on corruption, but warned that it must be impartial, factual and bereft of politics. “If we have institutions that are directed by the politics of the day, then Kenya is doomed,” said Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika said the corruption fight should be objective. “Due to the fact that the vice is eating into our development agenda, it must be tamed. Ample space However, let it not be an agenda behind an agenda. It should be thoroughly wiped out not through the media but by courts,” she said. Kalonzo said agencies entrusted to fight corruption should be given ample space to do their work.
