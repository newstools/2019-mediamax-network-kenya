Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have grounded all Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets, following the Sunday morning crash that killed all the 157 on board. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has also announced they had grounded the fleet, just few hours after the digital flight data recorder was recovered. Reports indicate the Sunday crash in Ethiopia bears similarities to the October 2018 incident in Indonesia involving the same model. The two aircraft were newly delivered Boeing 737 MAX 8 and both accidents occurred shortly after takeoff. As a result, questions have been asked on whether a design issue that arose during the earlier accident could be to blame. The Civil Aviation Administration of China yesterday said all domestic Boeing jets had to be out of the air by 6pm local time, due to its principle of “zero tolerance for safety hazards”. The Chinese authorities said they would contact both Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration to confirm “flight safety” issues before allowing the planes to resume flights. Though China has one of the world’s largest fleets—97 planes—of the Boeing, the authorities said that they would ensure “smooth travelling for passengers.” Boeing is also facing another problem of passenger confidence that has taken a hit, with travellers around the world expressing fears about the plane’s safety. Some said they were now scared of flying while others changed flights to other aircraft. Safety precaution China’s move came shortly after Ethiopia announced that it had already grounded its fleet, as an “extra safety precaution”. Later, Indonesia also announced that it would halt flights. Lion Air, which is based in Indonesia, is one of the biggest customers, having ordered 201 Max planes and taken delivery of 14. A number of countries have reacted to the crash with South Korea conducting a special inspection of the aircraft, while in Europe, regulators said they were in contact with their US counterparts as well as Boeing. Two Indian airlines that use the 737 Max jet — Jet Airways India Ltd and SpiceJet Ltd  — and the country’s regulators have asked Boeing for information following the Ethiopia crash. Muilenburg, who has overseen a tripling in the shares since taking over, now faces his biggest crisis following the grounding as the jet is Boeing’s most important aircraft type, generating almost a third of the company’s operating profit. Voice recorder The Boeing technical team had travelled to the crash site to provide technical assistance under the direction of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and US National Transportation Safety Board. Yesterday, the team recovered the cockpit voice and flight-data recorders, a significant step forward in piecing together the cause of the crash. Twin-engine jet Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam, said that the pilot had reported technical difficulties and had been given clearance to return to the Ethiopian capital. He, however, said a routine maintenance check hadn’t revealed anything before take-off, adding that the pilot had flown more than 8,000 hours and had an excellent flying record. At the same time, Boeing has delayed plans to unveil its huge new 777X jetliner today following the crash. Boeing had last week announced it would launch the twin-engine jet, which can carry as many as 425 passengers, today (Tuesday). Dubbed “the boss” by Boeing, the 777X has the largest jet engines the aerospace industry has ever developed.fortably tastes five lampstands. Dwarves auctioned off five tickets.
