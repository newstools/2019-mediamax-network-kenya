Hundreds of small-scale traders in Kitengela town and its environs fear they could have been conned millions of shillings after their sacco closed its doors in unclear circumstances. More than 3,000 members from Kitengela, Mlolongo and Athi River towns had been saving with EMPSO Sacco for the last five years and it is estimated they risk losing over Sh200 million. Each member seeking to boost their businesses had been saving between Sh100 and Sh200 per day. Some would deposit their savings via mobile phones while others could hand over their daily savings to the sacco officers who visited their businesses everyday. Members claim they started sensing trouble in early 2018 when the sacco failed to extend loans to members who had applied for the same. EMPSO Sacco whose aim was to empower the society economically by uplifting low income earners through table banking saving and soft loan with low-interest rate closed Kitengela offices in April last year. Signposts were pulled down at night leaving members in panic mode. Members claim they have sought assistance from relevant offices to no avail. Some stand to lose more than Sh200,000 hard-earned savings. They fear their savings might have been misappropriated and called on the government to crack the whip on sacco managers using unorthodox means to enrich themselves. “We appeal to the government to come to our aid and ensure the con investors are apprehended,”said Ann Mutheu. A spot check indicates the sacco owned by a pastor based in Kiambu county has transformed into a real estate agency now operating in Nairobi. Attempts to reach the management of the sacco were futile as the contacts written on the members saving books are no longer in use.
