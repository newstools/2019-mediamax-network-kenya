When it is Makadem in concert you know it’s going down with this god of benga. I particularly worship this man’s music even though I have zero understanding of Luo. And this Thursday I wasn’t going to miss his show for anything. The beauty about my job is the ability to combine work and play like two peas perfectly existing in a pod. So when I went to J’s Fresh Bar and Kitchen on Muthagari Drive, I put on my dancing pants and comfortable shoes, preceded by a sumptuous dinner to fuel my night. That done, I was on my way. I will admit that I missed his first set, but got there just in time for the second and longest. In the short break after the first session, people retreated to their seats to catch their breath and sip on their drinks as Makadem and his crew did the same. Before long they were back and the whole house was vibrating with the benga maestro’s voice and the swift sound of his Nyatiti. Truly, music is a universal language and people do not have to understand your tongue to enjoy your music. That is one incredible thing about African music, it brings people of diverse ethnicities together. That’s what Makadem’s music does. It flows into your soul and you can’t help but move along with it. Together with his back up set, the music powerhouse, and his Nyatiti (which lies in the class of the lyre and not the harp as people often assume) thrilled the dancing crowd with the ecstasy of live music. It was obvious that people adore this man. Makadem carries himself with a striking gentleness. He dances with an appealing soft execution that is crowned by his powerful voice. And with that, he captivated the full house to the end. There was a bonus performance when the crowd demanded more of his music and soon after, DJ Jones was on the decks spiralling the night into ecstatic bliss. The first song on his playlist was the famous hit Atoti. We had no time to rest because the dance floor was calling with back-to-back old school Kenyan hits in the air.
