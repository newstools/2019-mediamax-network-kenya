Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) are seeking State compensation for being linked to a terror group. In the hearing of a case in which Muhuri has sued the government for linking it to al Shabaab, the organisation told judge Dora Chepkwony (pictured) in Mombasa punitive damages would be the best remedy for defamation. In his final submission lawyer Willis Otieno for Muhuri asked the judge to order the State to pay special, general, aggravated and exemplary damages for allegations that lobby was funding terrorism. On April 7, 2015, Muhuri was among 85 organisations blacklisted over alleged terror funding links, following Garissa University College terror attack. Justice Chepkwony said a notice of judgment would be issued within 14 days.
