After being licenced by The Kenya Copyrights Board, three collective management organisations have vowed to implement all conditions set by the regulatory body, including distribution of 70 per cent of revenues collected. Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP), Performers Rights Society of Kenya (PRISK) and Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK), through their chairmen, stated that they will only take 30 per cent of the money collected and are also planning to put in place a digital system that will enhance licensing and ensure precise distribution of royalties. “We remain committed to implementing the new joint licensing tariffs. We will be calling for proposals for the acquisition of a new digital licensing system that will enable rights users to pay for and get their licence online,” MCSK chairman Japheth Kassanga said.
