by Christine Musa @PeopleDailyKe Patients in Kajiado county have raised the red flag over poor services in public health facilities. The patients claim medics at the facilities refer them to private hospitals and clinics near the hospitals  as well as force them to buy drugs at specific pharmacies. Investigations by the People Daily  have revealed that most private facilities are owned by doctors serving at the hospitals. Despite being supplied with drugs by the county government, they claimed they are only given painkillers  and asked to buy the rest. They  accused medics  of  unethical practices at the expense of suffering patients. “Nowadays, every patient is being subjected to laboratory test even when you only have flu. Referrals for scans where you part with Sh1,000 have also become a common phenomenon,’’ said Alice Njeri, a resident. A source at Kitengela hospital  claimed government drugs are shared among medics, who own private facilities in far flung areas. When contacted for comment, Governor Joseph Lenku (pictured) said they have launched investigations into the matter and ordered profiling of all private clinics to establish owners and investigations into loss of millions worth of  drugs launched. “We have pumped money into the health department. Patients must get value for money,” he said adding that those found guilty will face the  full force of the law.
