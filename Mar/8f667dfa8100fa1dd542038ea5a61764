Tell us about yourself My name is Milo Lankester. I am 11 years old and  I go to Pembroke House in Nakuru. You’ve participated in a number of cycling events. When did you begin cycling? At the age of three when I was bought a bike, and instantly fell in love with riding. How tough is practicing for events? It is very tough. You fall many times and get bruises. You have to wake up early in the morning and cycle, even when you don’t feel like. How do you train? My dad is my greatest support and I train with him and my dogs. I also have a personal trainer, David Kinja, who trains the renowned Chris Froome. We cycle a lot around Gilgil, which has a great terrain for exercise. What other support do you receive from your parents? They push me to work harder and sponsor my events, as well as get me the equipment I need. How many awards have you won so far? I’ve participated in 73 races. I won an Amboseli race for two years and another race that was in Eburru forest. The first race that I ever won was a children’s race, where I climbed 30km with my bike. I managed to become second in the Mount Kenya kids cycling race. How do the awards make you feel? I feel happy and they motivate me to work even harder, practise more and win many more. What other activities are you involved in apart from cycling? I love rugby and athletics. How do you balance cycling and schoolwork? I cycle during weekends and holidays. The rest of the time, I’m in school studying. What’s your favourite subject? PE, because I love sports and I want to do the same in future. What would you like to be in future? I would like to be an athlete. I love running. Advice to other kids? Train and take it easy. Don’t stress too much. Concentrate, be determined and don’t give up in whatever you do.
