Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu Amos Mbicha recalls the jokes he shared with his younger sister Stella Konarskar via WhatsApp last Thursday, when she informed him of her plans to fly home from Saudi Arabia on Sunday. He remembers how Konarskar sounded nostalgic, indicating how much she missed being home. The chat at around 9.30am on Thursday would be the last between the siblings as Konarskar and her three-year-old son Adam would perish in the ill-fated Ethiopian Airline crash on Sunday. Mbicha said he received a call at around 9.30am on Sunday from another sibling in Nairobi, informing him of the plane crash news. Fifteen minutes later, Mbicha says, a list of victims’ names popped up on a WhatsApp group and her sister’s name was among them. “I didn’t see the name of my nephew but I believe it is because they were sharing a seat with the mother,” he says. “Besides being a sister, I have lost a friend. She was the support system for our family,” he added in an interview with People Daily at Kikambala. The deceased, who was married to a polish, was last in Kenya in November, 2018. She had studied Psychology at  the University of Nairobi.
