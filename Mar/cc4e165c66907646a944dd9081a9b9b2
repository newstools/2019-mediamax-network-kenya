San Francisco, Thursday Facebook  grappled Thursday with a more than 14-hour disruption to all of its products that left them mostly inaccessible across the world. The company’s main social network, its two messaging apps and image-sharing site Instagram were all affected. Facebook has yet to offer an explanation for the outage. The last time Facebook had a disruption of this magnitude was in 2008, when the site had 150 million users, compared with around 2.3 billion monthly users today. The outage began Wednesday afternoon and only showed real signs of recovery Thursday morning. This meant core platforms many people rely on every day to communicate were rendered useless. Those on Instagram were not able to refresh feeds or post new material. Facebook Messenger’s desktop version did not load – but the mobile app appeared to allow the sending of some messages; however, users reported glitches with other kinds of content, such as images. WhatsApp, Facebook’s other messaging app, had similar problems. “We’re aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps,” Facebook said in a statement, posted on Twitter. “We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.” In response to rumours posted on other networks, the company said the outages were not a result of a Distributed Denial of Service attack, known as DDoS—a type of cyber-attack that involves flooding a target service with extremely high volumes of traffic. -BBC
