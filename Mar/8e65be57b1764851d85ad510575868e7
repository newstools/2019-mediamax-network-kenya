Kinyuru Munuhe and Wangu Gacheche Outgoing Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has directed officers attached to Close Quarter Protection to VIPs to stop harassing motorists. Boinnet issued the directive after incessant outrage by motorists decrying unruly conduct of officers flouting traffic rules by driving on the wrong side, overlapping and forcing their way, which disrupts traffic flow. “All officers on VIP security duties have, therefore, been instructed to stop this trend forthwith; must follow the Highway Code and obey the traffic law like other motorists,” said Boinnet. The Kenya Traffic Act does not exempt anyone from following traffic regulations. The VIPs’ drivers and aides, mostly police officers, have in many occasions been involved in accidents attributed to flouting of traffic rules. “This unacceptable behaviour has not only caused anger and concern from the motoring public but has also resulted to untold suffering and inconveniences. Some of these officers have in the past been engaging in reckless behaviour and have been harassing other motorists in the name of allowing  VIPs quick passage,” said Boinnet. In June 2005, former President Daniel Arap Moi’s motorcade was involved in a road accident along Waiyaki Way when his convoy rammed into a Stagecoach bus at Museum Hill. At the height of presidential campaigns in December 2002, former President Mwai Kibaki, then a presidential candidate, was involved in an accident at the Machakos turn-off on Nairobi-Mombasa highway while travelling to Nairobi after campaign rallies in Lower Eastern region.
