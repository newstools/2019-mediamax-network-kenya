Fierce competition is expected this weekend in boys’ basketball when coaches and school teams lock horns in search of tickets to the Term One national school games to be held at Shimo La Tewa High School in Mombasa next month. The Nairobi regional competitions starting today through to Sunday bring together schools across the 11 Nairobi sub-counties which constitute a county and a region at the same time thus skipping the county level competition. Missing out Upper Hill basketball team who are three-time national champions and also 2013 East Africa winners are looking to return to the national stage after missing out in the 2018 edition. They start their ticket campaign in Pool B against Rafiki Secondary and Jamhuri. The side, however, have Dagoretti High to worry about. Dagoretti upset the formbook in last year’s championship, beating Upper Hill to win Nairobi’s only ticket for their maiden appearance to the nationals with a 58-51 score. In girls’ basketball, holders Buruburu begin their title defence in pool A against St Teresa’s Girls and Rafiki Secondary.  Arch-rivals and last year’s losing finalists Parklands Arya are in Pool F against OLM and Ngara Girls.
