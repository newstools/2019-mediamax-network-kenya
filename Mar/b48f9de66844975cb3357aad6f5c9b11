Lynette Matheka @PeopleSport11 When Simon Ngige walked the course at the little-known Njoro Golf Club accompanying his father and late uncle, little did he know that he was sowing a love for golf that would make him the best Kenyan golfer at the inaugural main European Tour event in Kenya. Thika Golf Club player finished T25 in a field of 144 after an impressive run that saw him finish at 5-under par 279 at the Magical Kenya Open that concluded yesterday at the Karen Country Club. The 33-year-old returned a three -under par 68 in the first round on Thursday to set himself up for making the cut after playing for one –over par 72 in the second round. Good game plan He returned a one-under par 70 on the third round after triple bogeying the par four, 18th and had a better day on the final round for a two-under par 69. His exploits saw him take home Sh 1.2 million from the Sh125 million prize money. “I had a beautiful day on the course in the final round but overall I played well and stuck to my game plan. There was no wind yesterday and I loved the support of the home fans although they distracted my playing partner,” said an elated Ngige. Ngige credits his win to a good game plan and proper preparations in the race to the Open. This is his 13th Kenya Open and the third time to make cut as a pro, having been on the money bracket in 2016 and 2017. He also made cut in 2007 as an amateur. “After missing out last year, I took advantage of the tournaments that were organised and played with a mindset of doing well at the Kenya Open and improving my game and I am happy it worked for me,” he added. The former Njoro Club golfer who moved to Thika and turned pro in 2009, plans to take a two-day rest and return to the range for more practice before taking part in invitational tournaments.
