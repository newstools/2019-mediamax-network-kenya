Why this particular car? The BMW E30 has a very rich history in motorsports and I’m keen on racing, specifically touring cars. It has been a special car in my life and when my father got the opportunity to buy it, I was really adamant and really pressured him into getting it. It wasn’t too hard as he’s also very passionate about BMWs. I can say that it was his dream as well to get another E30 and specifically the convertible version. What do you love about it? The standard E30 is quite the head turner. It’s a classic beauty and this one being a convertible even more so. I love its rich sporting history, but above all I love just how it feels behind the wheel. It’s a quick car, and anyone who’s ever driven one will attest to its beautiful handling dynamics. It really does define the BMW brand and the Ultimate Driving Machine philosophy. It has the famed M20 engine which is a 2.5 litre straight six and absolutely bulletproof. It’s also very reliable. Drawbacks? In Kenya I have to say it’s simply not having a place or time to thoroughly enjoy wheeling. Today is a Saturday, ideally the perfect day made for such cars. But everywhere you turn traffic is bumper to bumper. Matatus and boda bodas are also quite the nuisance as they don’t appreciate a classic car and will very easily leave you with a dent or worse. So you have to be careful in selecting your route and traffic conditions. Another drawback is that since I’m in South Africa most of the time, I only get to drive it a few times of the year when I come on holiday. It also broke down quite a lot during restoration as these cars are wont to do, but it’s all good now.
