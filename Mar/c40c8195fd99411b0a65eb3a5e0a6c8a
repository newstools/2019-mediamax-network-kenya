Zadock Angira Police are investigating an incident in which a Nairobi lawyer shot and killed his 29-year-old son in his car minutes after they left church yesterday. Assa Nyakundi, who has since been arrested, told police he accidentally shot Joseph Nyakundi in the chest near their Muthaiga home at about 1pm. He said the incident happened as he stopped driving to change the position of his pistol on arrival. Nyakundi, a licenced gun holder, had a Glock pistol with 15 bullets with him at that time. He runs a law firm Nyakundi & Co Advocates. His clients include Nyeri magistrate Pauline Chesang, who is charged with the murder of her husband. He is also representing a number of suspects charged with the National Youth Service scandal. Nyakundi and his son, who was in the back seat, had left ICC Church on Mombasa Road. He took him to Aga Khan Hospital after the incident, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. He later reported the incident at Muthaiga Police Station. Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo (pictured) said investigations are underway to establish circumstances under which Nyakundi shot his son. “It is unfortunate a life has been lost, more so his son. We are looking into the matter,” said Ndolo.
