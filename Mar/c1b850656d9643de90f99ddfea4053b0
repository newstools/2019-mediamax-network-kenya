George Owoko and his Nairobi Stima side are eyeing a perfect end to the first leg as they remain the only unbeaten team in the National Super League heading to the last match of the opening half of the season this weekend. Stima are second on the 20-team table with 38 points, same as Wazito and three behind leaders Ushuru and their desire will come under test against 15th placed Eldoret Youth. “It is another game, not necessarily straight forward because no opponent is easy. All we need is to focus and play as per the plan,” said Owoko. Meanwhile, leaders Ushuru will be hoping to keep up their recent momentum when they face eighth-placed Kenya Police in today’s early kick-off. Three straight wins The taxmen have strung together three straight wins, the last being a 3-0 drubbing of Kangemi Allstars, pushing them to 41 points and Ken Kenyatta’s charges are keen to avoid the disappointments of the last two seasons where they missed out on direct promotions. Meanwhile, Fred Ambani takes temporary charge of Wazito FC in their match against St Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium following the sacking of Mohamed Mchula. The former Kenyan international will be out to earn the trust of his bosses with a win over after two consecutive losses saw Muchula dispensed with. Another thriller at Camp Toyoyo will pit fifth-placed FC Talanta and Shabana who have dropped to ninth after a bright start to the season.
