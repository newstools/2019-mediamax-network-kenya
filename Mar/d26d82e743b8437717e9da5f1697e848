Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi An announcement made at Bole International Airport for passengers wishing to board flight ET302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi would have been a death trap for Elizabeth Kabuthi and four colleagues. An employee at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret, Kabuthi is yet to come to terms with her narrow escape. She had left Cairo, Egypt at 2.20am and landed in Addis Ababa at 7.20am for her connecting flight to Nairobi but at the airport, Kabuthi and her colleagues  decided to take a rest and instead take a later flight. Speaking to People Daily by the phone from her Huruma Estate, Kabuthi said: “It was a blessing in disguise that I did not board the plane.” “I am still in shock,” she added.Her colleague Jane Kamau was, however, not so lucky. She perished in the ill-fated flight that left 157 people dead, among them 32 Kenyans. Kamau was travelling home after attending a week-long conference in Cairo, Egypt. Her son, Kenneth Kamau, recalled his last moments with his mother. Loving person “Before she left for the conference, she asked me to take care of the house because she would not be around for one week. We last talked on phone before she left Cairo for Addis Ababa,” he said. Kamau described his  mother as loving and was keen on his education. The Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology graduate said he is yet to come to terms with the loss as MTRH staff visited their home in Shauri Moyo estate to condole with the family.
