Amos Abuga Enosh Ochieng scored from the spot with Ulinzi’s first shot on target to hand them a 1-1 draw with Tusker in SportPesa Premier League match staged at the Ruaraka Grounds yesterday. The goal on the stroke of the hour mark saw the two sides share spoils once again, an upgrade from the goalless draw in the first leg. Sydney Ochieng’s first half cracker from the edge of the box was perceived to have ended the brewers  four game losing streak, but it never happened. Ochieng’s sublime goal with 35 minutes on the clock had James Saruni well beaten.The Brewers who were largely untroubled had their lead safe at the break. Barely threatened Ulinzi’s forward line of Ezekiel Okero and Enosh Ochieng barely threatened Robert Mboya in goal, it is no understatement that the soldiers had no short on target in the first half. The match also saw the return of Ugandan midfielder Hashim Sempala. The player who has been out due to illness put in a captain’s performance. After the breather Ulinzi scored from the spot, Ochieng sending Mboya the wrong side. The soldiers first shot on target. Marlon Tangauzi had handled the ball in the box. It the end Tusker remained sixth on the log with 26 points while Ulinzi have 22 points. In Awendo, hosts Sony beat Bandari 2-0 as Nzoia were held to a one-all draw at Bukhungu
