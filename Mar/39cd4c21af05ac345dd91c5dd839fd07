Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi The controversy surrounding the management of the giant women’s body Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation (MYWO)  took a new twist yesterday after some top leaders asked the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti to investigate alleged misuse of Sh12 million monthly rent from Maendeleo House in Nairobi. Led by National first vice-chairperson Eileen Kendagor, they accused embattled MYWO national chairperson Rahab Mwikali of running down the once vibrant organisation. She spoke at Lelin Campsite along Kerio Valley during a meeting to fill the vacant chair, treasurer, secretary and organising secretary positions of MYWO Elgeyo Marakwet chapter after the former holders resigned three years ago. “We urge the DCI to expedite investigations into alleged mismanagement of millions of shillings collected from tenants from Maendeleo House annually,” she said. Kendagor accused Mwikali of being a stumbling block to efforts by women affiliated to MYWO to carry out the reforms aimed at steering the organisation back to its former glory. The women’s body, Kendagor complained, has become dormant with all activities geared towards empowering women at the grassroots going under since Mwikali took over the leadership of the umbrella body six years ago. “Millions of money collected annually from Maendeleo House rent cannot be accounted for,” she claimed.
