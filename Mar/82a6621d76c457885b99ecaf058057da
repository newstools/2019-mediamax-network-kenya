The National Assembly Committee on Health has expressed reservations over Kenya Medical Supplies Agency’s (Kemsa) capacity to supply drugs under the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programme. Committee chairperson Sabina Chege told Kemsa management the agency would have to change its mode of operations to match current trends, especially costing and delivering of supplies, for it to succeed in its role in UHC. “Kemsa is not competitive in the market, procurement and delivery of drugs, which raises questions as to the agency’s capacity to handle UHC,” said Chege. Kemsa management had been invited by the committee to provide information on whether it has the capacity to supply all medicines needed by hospitals in the country and the challenges the agency faces in this respect. Cost implication According to Chege, Kemsa was overpricing products ,among other inadequacies.  “We have compared prices and you’re the most expensive in the market,” she said. Kenyatta National Hospital  (KNH) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital have opted out of the deal with Kemsa, citing cost implication. Seme MP James Nyikal questioned why the agency was procuring drugs from cartels and brokers instead of getting the same from manufacturers. In response, Kemsa chief executive Jonah Manjari cited inadequate and inaccurate health-related data, especially on consumption, unreliable and inadequate quantification and erratic ordering by the counties as challenges the agency faces. He said delayed payment by some counties and deliveries by some suppliers, insecurity and poor infrastructure in some parts of the country affect last mile delivery. He said the agency  has a total storage space of 663,564 sq feet.
