Addressing the press on Thursday, North Coast EACC manager Gichangi Njeru said detectives suspected a private school in the outskirts of Malindi town, run by one of the suspects Philip Kimaro, was involved in the scheme. “We conducted a search in the school and recovered dozens of government-branded textbooks and others bearing stamps of public schools in the county,” he said. Gichangi said the suspects were taken to EACC offices for interrogation and to help in the ongoing investigations. He said the texts books bearing the stamps of government schools were being shipped to private schools by dishonest teachers.
