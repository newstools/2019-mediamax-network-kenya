BRIDE: EMMY WAMBUI GROOM: JAMES WESA DATE: FEBRUARY 23, 2019 VENUE: ST NICHOLAS SENIOR SCHOOL, NGONG ROAD VIDEO AND PHOTOGRAPHY: SHAA STUDIOS BRIDE’S GOWN: JUDIS GOWNS GROOM’S SUIT: VINNIE THE DESIGNER How long did you date? James: We dated for a year and a half before we decided to make things official. Tell us about the proposal? It was awesome and simple. We planned and executed it on Emmy’s birthday, which was on September 21, at a friend’s house. She didn’t even see it coming. You had two bold dominating colours. How did you choose the theme for your wedding? Being an outdoor wedding, we went for a blend of purple and fuchsia. We needed that pop of colour. Besides, they are both our favourite colours. How much did your wedding cost? We wanted a simple yet elegant wedding. We are not spendthrifts, so we worked with Sh440,000 inclusive of our personal budget and we hacked it in just two months of planning! How many guests did you have? Initially, we had planned for 300 guests, but I think we exceeded that number.  We thank God that everything went well and everyone was catered for. Any challenges? Being that we had a two-month period to do everything, it was hectic moving around and ensuring that everything went as planned. Also, at some point, we had some financial constraints, trying to offset pending bills. However, our families and church really came through for us. What was most memorable about your big day? Kissing the bride and her parents handing her over to me. Emmy: Walking down the aisle and seeing my husband at the end was quite emotional.
