Turin, Monday @PeopleSports11 Juventus’ Champions League hopes are hanging on Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) pulling off another sensational comeback as the Italians trail 2-0 to defensive specialists Atletico Madrid going into the last 16, second-leg tie in Turin on Tuesday. “We didn’t expect to lose the first leg 2-0, but anything can happen, and we want to give a great response in our home, in front of our fans,” Ronaldo told Juventus TV ahead of the game in the Allianz Stadium. “These are the great nights, the fantastic ones: the Champions League nights,” he continued.  “The team is confident of playing a great game and I am too. To the fans I say: think positive, let’s believe. “Get ready to come back!” The seven-time reigning Italian champions bought Ronaldo last summer from Real Madrid for 100 million euros ($117 million) to end their Champions League heartbreak going back 23 years. Expectations The 34-year-old’s stunning overhead kick for Real in the quarter-finals in Turin last April had dumped Juventus out of the tournament once again. Expectations are high that he can reproduce his improbable hat-trick which lifted Real Madrid past Wolfsburg in April 2016 with the Spaniards 2-0 down to the Germans after the first leg. Juventus have come from behind in the elite European competition eight times — including in the 1996 quarter-finals against Real Madrid on their way to winning the title. They also lifted the European trophy in 1985, but have finished runners-up five times since their last success, including twice in the past four years.       -AFP
