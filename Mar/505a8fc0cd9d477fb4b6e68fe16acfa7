Why this bike? I’ve actually had this bike for about seven years now. It was simply sitting at home gathering dust and rust when I decided to revive it. I wanted a bike that was different, nothing like what you would see on the road. I am very passionate about motorbikes and decided to customise it to my preference since I appreciate a bike with character. I’m a tall guy at 6’4” and at that height you are limited for options when it comes to motorbikes you can ride comfortably. It, therefore, made sense to make a bike that not only reflected my style, but was also comfortable for my height. What exactly did you do to it? The chassis/frame is originally a dirt bike, I started by getting rid of all the unnecessary parts and then took it to a welder who chopped it up to make it smaller and lowered shocks. I replaced the tank with something more retro, fitted new tyres and a fresh lick of paint. The finished product doesn’t look anything like a dirt bike. I was going for a café racer look and I’m happy with how it turned out. What does it do for you? In a word, it’s my therapy! Riding any bike on a smooth road on a beautiful day is simply therapeutic and puts a smile on your face. If it’s a bike that you have built for yourself, it is doubly satisfying when you look at it and feel the performance, especially when you gun it on a sweet road. What are some of the downsides? Well it’s still a work in progress and there are some things I need to do before I consider it done. The seat, for instance, could definitely be more comfortable, it’s not ideal, especially for long rides. I also need to rework the electrics and fit a battery so I can fit an electronic ignition system. Kick start is annoying especially on cold days.
