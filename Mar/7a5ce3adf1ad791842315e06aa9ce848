By Amos Abuga The much awaited Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) elections will go on as planned from 3pm this afternoon at the Rugby Football of East Africa grounds’ Union office. This is after the union directors and the three candidates for the chairmanship position met and decided to brush aside the government proposal to have the polls postponed. An insider claimed that a plan had been hatched at the weekend during the Kenya Open Golf Championships in Karen, by a notorious clique with powerful connections at the Sports Ministry, who wanted the indefinite suspension of the Union polls so that a Care Taker Committee is appointed to be headed by a former Union boss who no longer have a grip to local rugby leadership. “The election is now on and from 3pm, we have to have it today,” said Alexander Mutai who is among the candidates for the chairmanship position. Union Secretary General Oduor Gangla said: “This decision is anchored upon clause 12.4 of the KRU constitution which provides that a duly constituted General Meeting can only be adjourned at that particular meeting.” Gangla is also in the race to be the next head of the Union, with the third candidate being Asiko Owiro.
