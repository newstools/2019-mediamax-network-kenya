The family of Mario Magonga, pilot of the ill-fated helicopter that crashed in Turkana killing all five occupants, has eulogised him as a hard working son who was kind and philanthropic. The 45-year-old died on Sunday with his passengers —four American tourists —when the helicopter crashed at Central Island National Park in Lake Turkana. Magonga’s mother Melania said it was painful to lose a son who had promised to build her a house in a plot he had bought in Kitale. “I could sense something was wrong even before the news reached me in the morning but did not expect report of death,” she said. Gladys Magonga, the pilot’s sister said she received the news at dawn from her brother’s wife who lives in Nairobi. She described her brother as a reserved person who took his work seriously and did not involve the family in the work he was doing because of its nature. “I was shocked and we had a litmus test in the morning trying to keep information from our mother because of her fragile health. The news was all over, so we had to shut down television, keep radio away and divert her phone calls,” she said. The chopper wreckage and bodies were found on Monday morning. “The tourists were set to travel on Monday to Central Island but one plane didn’t land at Lobolo,” Turkana Deputy Commissioner Alexander Motivo said. -KNA
