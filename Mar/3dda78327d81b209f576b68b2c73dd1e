Plans by the government  to bail out cash-trapped East Africa Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) by having the firm sell part of its 16,000 acre land in Athi River within the outskirts of Nairobi have hit headwinds. The cement maker has already earmarked 900 acres for sale to Kenya Railways Corporation to construct a multi-million-shilling inland port in a bid to raise the Sh15 billion required for its revival. The cement maker is partly owned by the government. Kenya Railways has paid EAPCC Sh1.2 billion down payment of the Sh5.2 billion value of the land as per the agreement between the two entities and allocated 69 acres of the 900 acres to Grain Bulk Handlers Ltd to set up a container terminus next to the standard gauge railway terminus. Plan by the company is to have 50 acres utilised to put up containers godowns and 19 acres used as service lanes. However, the local community under Aimi Ma Lukenya Society with a membership of more than 5,000 are up in arms over the plan to establish an inland container depot in the area. The locals claim ownership of the land, alleging that EAPCC has used forged documents to clinch the deal and is selling land it does not own. Armed with a title deed and other documents that People Daily could not immediately establish their authenticity, the agitated locals cried foul, saying the move comes to them as a shocker. Court order The locals have a court order dated February 15, 2019 stopping any development on the disputed piece of land. In the past one week, the area has been a battleground between security officers manning the ongoing boundary marking process by surveyors and locals opposing the project. The society chairman Julius Mutua said police have used excessive force to harass and forcibly evict them from the property they allegedly own.“We served the police with a court order stopping any developer from conducting any activity in our land but they defied the order,” he said.
