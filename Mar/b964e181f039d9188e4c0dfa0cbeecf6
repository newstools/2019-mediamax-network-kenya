It is turning out to be one of the tightest races for promotion to the SportPesa Premier League as the three leading teams in the second tier National Super League are tied on 41 points while the fourth-placed side is just two points adrift. At the conclusion of the first leg last weekend, Ushuru, Nairobi Stima and Wazito are all on 41 points, only separated by goal difference while Kisumu All Stars have 39, making the promotion race a hotly-contested affair. The taxmen have a superior goal difference (+24) over their challengers having conceded only seven against 31 scored while Stima, whoÂ  have made history of their own by going unbeaten in the first half of the season, have scored 31 and let in 15 to sit second followed by Wazito (scored 29, conceded 14). Kisumu All Stars are not far off, as they have scored more goals (34) that the leading trio and given they are just two points behind, the leaders cannot afford any slip-ups in the second leg. FC Talanta, who have seen their early season momentum fizzle out, are still in with a shout, sitting fifth on the 20-team table with 36 points, five behind the leaders. Woeful Shabana However, the first leg has not been kind to former giants Shabana who had hopes of promotion. Tore Bobe began the season brightly but slumped thereafter, losing momentum and they now find themselves ninth on the table with 28 points, 13 behind the leaders following seven losses in 19 matches with their promotion quest looking all but over. At the lower end of the table, Migori Youth, Nairobi City Stars, Kangemi All Stars and Green Commandoes have all garnered less than 15 points and will need to up their game in the second leg if they have to avoid the drop.
