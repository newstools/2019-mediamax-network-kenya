George Kebaso @Morarak National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich yesterday denied any involvement in the alleged embezzlement of billions of shillings meant for construction of two dams in Elgeyo Marakwet county. The CS defended himself on a day sources at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) indicated that he had been summoned for the second time today to record a statement under caution. Recording a statement under caution means whatever he utters could be used against him in court. In a lengthy statement to newsrooms, Rotich said all projects, whether domestic or externally funded, are implemented in strict adherence to the law and in accordance with the commercial and financing agreements. Accurate and credible “In this particular case, if there were any breaches, the ongoing investigations will capture them,” Rotich said as Elgeyo Senator Kipchumba Murkomen sensationally dismissed the ongoing graft probe of the Kimwarer and Arror multipurpose dam projects by the DCI. Speaking at the Senate yesterday, Murkomen said the DCI is maliciously targeting the two projects. “Even though other projects, some of which have taken two to three years to commence with larger allocations, none has attracted the kind of criticism and attack from the DCI or media like the Arror and Kimwarer projects,” he said. Rotich said while Treasury is ready to provide information with regard to financing of the projects upon request, he insisted that information provided to the public through the media should be accurate and credible. Yesterday, Rotich outlined the financing arrangements followed in the procurement of a contractor for the two projects.
