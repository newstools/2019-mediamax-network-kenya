Gerald Ithana @PeopleSports Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen scored a double as the Senate football team won the Devolution Cup after beating the County Assembly Forum (CAF) team 4-0 in the final in Kirinyaga yesterday. Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot and Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka were the other goal scorers for the winners. The Senate team made it to the finals after a hard-fought 9-8 post-match penalties win over the Council of Governors (CoG) team. The entertaining match had concluded one-all in regular time. Golden Boot award Governors were off their blocks faster, with the opening goal scored in the first minute, while Murkomen, who also took home the Golden Boot award after hitting the back of the net thrice, equalising for the Senate team in the fourth minute of the second half. However, it was a massive improvement for the Governors from the last edition of the Devolution Cup in Kakamega County, where they were hammered 5-0 by the Senators. CAF on the other hand had an easier route to the final after they made mincemeat of Ugatuzi FC, walloping them 5-1. The team, comprising Members of County Assemblies, dominated the match from start to finish. The MultiChoice Kenya sponsored Devolution Cup, a pre-cursor to the sixth Annual Devolution Conference was played at Kerugoya Boys High School.  Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru welcomed Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa as the chief guest to the games.
