Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe A private security workers welfare organisation has condemned the killing of five guards in Kilingili area, Vihiga county by a suspected local gang. Kenya National Private Security Workers Union (KNPSWU) secretary general Isaac Andabwa called for immediate arming of guards with guns. However, he said specialised training should be offered as a prerequisite. “We expect the process of arming guards to be fast-tracked now that it is evident they are defenceless. A guard should protect himself or herself against violent attacks,” said Andabwa (pictured) during the election of KK Security shop stewards, Industrial Area branch in Nairobi. According to the union boss, the Kilingili incident was not an isolated one, similar killings have happened in Machakos, Karura Forest, Garissa, Kakamega, Lamu and at a petrol station along Nakuru-Naivasha highway. Thomas Lusiolo, Linus Anyika, Francis Jojo Osayo, John Ondachi and Charles Kalume were killed by the suspected vigilante group still at large just a few metres from local police station.
