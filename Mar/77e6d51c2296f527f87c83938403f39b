Bernice Mbugua and Nancy Gitonga @BerniceMuhindi The High Court has barred Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulai from transferring or disposing of property in Karen for six months. Justice John Onyiego issued the temporary orders yesterday to enable Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to complete investigations before instituting recovery proceedings. “An order of prohibition is hereby issued prohibiting the respondents jointly and severally, their agents, servants or any other persons from transferring, disposing of or in any other way dealing with the properties listed herein to enable EACC to complete its investigations,” ordered Onyiego. In its application, EACC has named the Governor and Oryx Service Station, which is associated with him, as respondents. In an affidavit by Joel Khisa, EACC said it is investigating allegations of corruption, economics crimes, bribery, and conflict of interest amongst contractors and county officials. The anti-graft body said Sh1.6 billion was embezzled between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2018 in Samburu County government. EACC said preliminary investigations show Oryx was awarded a contract to supply diesel and petrol to the county between 2014 and 2019. “Investigations have revealed that the governor, through the company, in 2013-2018 received a sum in excess of Sh80,763,715.35, payments made by the county,” said Khisa in court documents. According to EACC, Lenolkulai on July 8, 2015 purchased property worth Sh15 million each  in Karen, suspected to have been bought with the said monies.
