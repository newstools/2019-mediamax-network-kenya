James Magayi @magayijim Flank players Mustafa Francis and Boniface Omondi scored within one minute of each other to turn around Gor Mahia’s fortunes as they came from behind to win 2-1 over Kakamega Homeboyz in a rescheduled Sportpesa Premier League (SPL) match in Machakos yesterday. The defending champions played too well for the side that had not trained since last Sunday and wanted the fixture shelved until after the hovering final CAF Confederation Cup Group D tie next Sunday against Petro Atletico of Angola. A simmering dispute over delayed February salaries also denied the team their usual first team stars. Six of the players who started against Zamalek were absent and Gor only had four players on the bench instead of the conventional seven. Jacques Tuyisenge, Francis Kahata, Dennis Oliech, Shafik Batambuze, Philemon Otieno were all absent from the match day squad leaving second fiddle players to fill the ranks. K’Ogalo nonetheless, seized the game by its scruff to deliver three points and a reminder that the 2018/2019 season is very much within their grasp. After dominating play for 50 minutes Gor went behind in Homeboyz’s first potent attack. Casual loss of possession by Lawrence Juma gifted Festo Omukoto the ball in midfield and in the swiftest of reactions by Homeboyz’s Allan Wanga and Ali Bai exchanged passes before the latter slotted the ball between K’Ogalo centre backs for Luke Namanda to finish delightfully. The stung Gor Mahia upped their pace and evened scores 17 minutes later, Mustafa Francis firing in from a crowded goalmouth after Homeboyz failed to deal with Geoffrey Ochieng’s menacing long throw. From the restart, K’Ogalo went ahead as Boniface Omondi’s low shot deflected off Festus Okiring to side foot David Juma who had already committed in Homeboyz goal line.
