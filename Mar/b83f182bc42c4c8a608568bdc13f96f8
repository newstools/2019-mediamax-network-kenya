Nakuru County Assembly has expressed concerns over acute staff shortage at Naivasha Sub-county Hospital, which was recently elevated to a Level 5 facility. House Health committee said there was urgent need to address the crisis given the hospital attends to hundreds of patients daily. This emerged when the committee visited the facility following complaints of understaffing, congestion and shortage of drugs. Addressing the press on Friday after the visit, committee chairman Njuguna Mwaura said they would recommend hiring of more staff in the coming financial year. He said the situation has been worsened by the high number of retiring staff, a situation that has overstretched services in the facility. “We are happy to report that there is no deficiency of drugs as reported but this hospital serves residents of neighboring counties and, therefore, has a shortage of medical personnel,” he said. The MCA said there was need to enhance services at the facility by constructing an intensive care unit (ICU) instead of referring patients to Nakuru PGH or Kenyatta National Hospital. “We are also working on providing incinerators to all public hospitals, which will be used to dispose medical waste instead of ferrying them to Nakuru,” he said. Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki said congestion at the facility would be addressed once the Sh300m modern outpatient wing is constructed by KenGen following a Presidential directive.
