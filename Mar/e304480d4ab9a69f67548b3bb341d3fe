Kisii Speaker David Kombo has warned Assembly committees’ chairmen against delaying reports sought by the House, saying they risk losing their sitting allowances. Kombo has given the chairmen up to Thursday, next week, to avail the reports failure to which he will take action against them. Speaking at the Assembly on Thursday, the Speaker said it was imperative for the Assembly to get reports for it to function. He also urged House Clerk James Nyaoga to publish weekly programmes on House Business for MCAs to be conversant with them. His remarks come a few days after committee chairmen raised concerns over getting frustrated when seeking information from the county executives. They said it was difficult for them to give answers on statements sought by colleagues in the House as the executives were unwilling to avail the information. Bassi Boitang’are MCA Bilancio Maturwa and his Bokimonge counterpart Amos Onderi said they would impeach county executives, who fail to give required information. Nominated MCA Naomi Bosire said there was tendency by the county executives to ignore House resolutions and adopted reports. “The matter of taking resolutions of this House lightly by some county executives is of great concern to all of us,” she said.
