Ushuru’s quest to earn direct promotion to the SportPesa Premier League remains on course after they made it four straight wins following a 3-0 thrashing of Kangemi All Stars while their main challengers Wazito FC lost 3-1 to FC Talanta in National Super League matches played yesterday. The easy victory takes the taxmen to the top of the standings with 41 points while Wazito are now relegated to second place with 38 points with one game left before the mid-season break. Brian Yakhama and captain Oscar Mbugua’s goals in the opening half made life difficult for bottom side Kangemi as they struggled to string together a proper strategy.  Kangemi struggled to break the rearguard of Ushuru which was manned by David Otieno and Fredrick Kentille. Ushuru’s pressure In the second half, Ushuru’s forwards including Edwin Mwaura and Barack Odhiambo piled pressure on the visitors as they sought to bury them while the slum boys tried to change tack by drawing out the opponents with counter attacks. Speedy winger Alex Sunga hit the last nail in the coffin in the final minute with a fine volley from inside the 18 yard area. The result spells doom for Kangemi who have garnered only eight points. “It was a good performance and the team who did everything right. I have told the guys to focus on the next match and not to be under any pressure to relinquish top spot,” said Ushuru coach Ken Kenyatta. Meanwhile, Kenya Police jumped to eighth spot on the log with 28 points after a 2-1 win over visiting Modern Coast Rangers. The law enforcers scored through Victor Melon and Abraham Dawo with Samuel Ate getting the consolation for the Coastal side.
