London, Wednesday Britain’s finance minister and business chiefs on Wednesday urged the country to avoid a “no deal” Brexit after another crushing parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May over her EU-divorce deal with Brussels. The fast-moving Brexit saga eclipsed the government’s budget update that slashed the 2019 economic growth forecast, with the UK economy also hit by China’s slowdown and trade war tensions. Vote due MPs will decide on Wednesday whether the country should leave the European Union without a deal, with analysts expecting parliament instead to favour delaying its departure beyond the March 29 exit date, in a further vote due Thursday. Britain’s economy is expected to expand by just 1.2 percent this year, down sharply from prior guidance of 1.6 percent, finance minister Phillip Hammond revealed in his budget update. The downgrade, widely expected after a similar move by the Bank of England, came one day after parliament overwhelmingly rejected May’s draft Brexit divorce agreement. “Last night’s vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy and … our most urgent task in this House is to lift that uncertainty,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond said in a budget thin on policy announcements. Significant disruption “Leaving with ‘no deal’ would mean significant disruption in the short and medium term, and a smaller, less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal,” he said. “That is not what the British people voted for in June 2016 in the referendum to leave the EU,” the chancellor added. —AFP
