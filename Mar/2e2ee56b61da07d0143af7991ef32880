Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Senate Leader of Majority Kipchumba Murkomen and Minority Leader James Orengo yesterday traded barbs over the government’s renewed war on corruption with the former claiming the purge is being used to settle political scores. Murkomen alleged independent institutions charged with fighting corruption have been infiltrated, saying they are being instructed by politicians on how to do their work. He said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and Director of Public Prosecutions are no longer independent institutions but have been turned into political tools to end some careers. “I want to tell my colleagues and all politicians, let us leave independent institutions to do their job without our directions and instructions,” he said. But Orengo dismissed Murkomen questioning why some leaders  are scared when their names are mentioned whenever there is graft talk.
