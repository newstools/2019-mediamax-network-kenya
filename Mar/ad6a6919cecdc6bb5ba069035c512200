Mathew Ndung’u and Oliver Musembi @People A meeting called by Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu in Thika to discuss Kiandutu slums resettlement programme ended in disarray after the dwellers rejected a committee appointed to oversee the programme. Waititu was forced to leave the podium in a huff after some residents demanded to have some of the committee members removed from the list, saying they were not consulted. They claimed Waititu was imposing the team on them. A committee of 60 people from 10 sub-villages had earlier been appointed by the governor to oversee the programme. Among the 60, two men, two women and two youths represent every village, respectively. The programme seeks to issue all the dwellers with a plot and a title deed to settle. Waititu, through the initiative also hopes to transform the village by establishing a modern sewerage system, pushing for all-time supply of clean water to all residents, erection of street and home lighting and construction of passable roads. The committee’s role is to enlist genuine Kiandutu dwellers to benefit from the programme whose main objective is to decongest the slum as well as to modernize the living of the thousands of Kenyans living there.
