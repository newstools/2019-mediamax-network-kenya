Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Barclays Bank of Kenya has reported a net profit of Sh7.42 billion for the period ended December 31, 2018, compared to Sh6.93 billion registered in a similar period in 2017. The seven per cent rise in profitability was bolstered largely by higher non-funded income. The non-funded income rose 15 per cent to Sh9.7 billion and net interest income increased one per cent to Sh21.99 billion. Barclays Bank closed the year with a loan book of Sh177.35 billion, a five per cent jump from the previous year, while customer deposits increased 11.5 per cent to Sh207.4 billion. The tier-one lender’s gross non-performing loans increased by Sh1.8 billion or 14.88 per cent to Sh13.9 billion in the period under review from Sh12.6 billion the previous year as its loan loss provision, booked as an expense in the income statement, jumped 24.2 per cent to Sh3.87 billion. Performance saw the bank declare a final dividend of 90 cents per share, bringing the total full-year payout to Sh1.1 per share representing a 10 per cent rise. Speaking yesterday during investors’ briefing, Barclays Bank Kenya Chief executive officer, Jeremy Awori, said the total assets of the group rose to Sh325 billion from Sh271.77 billion in 2017, while the net loans and advances increased five per cent to Sh177.35 billion. He said the non-funded income was mainly from the diversification, the bank has embraced especially after the Government enacted the interest rates cap in 2017. Some of the diversification undertaken includes trade finance, bancassurance, investment bank, equity brokerage, SMEs, Timiza, fixed income and wealth management.
