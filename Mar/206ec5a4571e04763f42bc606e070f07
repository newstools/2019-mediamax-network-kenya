Barry Silah and Fred Likuyani @PeopleSports11 Nairobi Stima were the big losers among the leading trio in the National Super League as they dropped two points while title rivals Wazito and Ushuru won their respective matches yesterday. With Stima being held to a barren draw by Bidco United, Wazito and Ushuru took advantage following victories against Nairobi City Stars and Migori Youth respectively. Joseph Waithira’s brace was crucial in ensuring Wazito start the second leg strong, the ex-Nakumatt attacker helping his club secure a crucial 3-2 win against City Stars. It was City Stars who scored first through early goals from Benson Iregi and Robert Ndungu in each half even after right back Wilson Anekeya had equalised in the first half before the visitors responded.  Meanwhile, Ushuru also earned full points after Brian Yakhama’s lone goal in the 49th minute sunk hosts Migori Youth in Awendo. Wins for Wazito and Ushuru leave both teams tied on top of the standings with 44 points, two ahead of Stima and five ahead of Kisumu All Stars who lost 3-1 to sixth-placed Administration Police. Late strike In Kakamega, Green Commandos and visitors Modern Coast Rangers battled to an entertaining 1-1 draw at Bukhungu Stadium. The hosts drew first blood through Castro Likhanga’s 42nd minute goal and they seemed to be holding on for maximum points before a late strike from midfielder Samuel Ate made 1-1 at full time.
