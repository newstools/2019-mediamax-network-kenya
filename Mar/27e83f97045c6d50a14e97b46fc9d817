Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and Director of Criminal Investigations   George Kinoti have been sued for contempt of court after continuing to post mugshots of suspects on social media. Bunge la Mwananchi president Henry Shitanda wants the duo committed to civil jail for six months for breach of a court order  issued on December 7, last year. The order by Justice Wilfrida Okwany barred Boinnet and Kinoti from posting mugshots of suspects on social media before they are arraigned. Justice James Makau directed the application be served to the respondents to appear on May 20 to make submission.
