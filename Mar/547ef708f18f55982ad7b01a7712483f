Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka yesterday called on the proponents of constitutional change to prioritise strengthening of Senate and devolution. Lusaka said if the clamour for constitutional change materialises into a referendum,  Senate will push for allocation of more funds to counties. He said Senate must be strengthened as a defender and guardian of devolution. “A legitimate referendum will bear the characteristic of strengthening devolution and the institution that safeguards it,” Lusaka told delegates at the ongoing  devolution conference in Kirinyaga. “A mechanism for increased resources to the counties must be sought in the process to ensure devolution succeeds,” he said. Some of those pushing for a  referendum want to scrap Senate, woman rep and nominated leaders’ seats to tame the wage bill. Council of Governors chair Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) said  they will only support referendum if it is to protect devolution.
