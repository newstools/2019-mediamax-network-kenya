Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe Cancer warrior Emmanuel Otieno, alias Jadudi has  succumbed to brain tumour. The University of Nairobi student who was diagnosed with cancer of the brain in 2012 died on Monday night at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu according to the facility’s chief executive Peter Okoth. “He was admitted here over five months ago and we have been trying to manage his condition but we unfortunately lost him,” said Prof Okoth. Jadudi’s brave  battle with the tumour attracted Kenyans in 2015 after media highlighted his plight. Kenyans responded to  the financial appeal and  raise Sh6.5 million to help him undergo the specialised treatment in India. He had undergone seven unsuccessful surgeries as doctors tried to save his life.
