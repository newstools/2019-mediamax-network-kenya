Mercy Mwai @wangumarci National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) is now on the spot for failure to take action on Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Limited Company over pollution of River Kibos. Muhoroni MP Onyango K’Oyoo  and civil society groups are accusing Nema of failing on its duty to protect citizens from harm. The move came after officials, led by Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu, cancelled a planned tour of the facility on a fact-finding mission. Wahungu said they had rescheduled the visit due to urgent meeting at the Busia border with his Ugandan counterpart on smuggling of plastic bags. “I have a schedule and sometimes it changes depending on where and what comes up,” he said. And following the move K’Oyoo threatened to mobilise his constituents to take unspecified action if the Nema doesn’t take “proper” action. He said Wahungu should quit for “failing to ensuring industries don’t pollute environment”. Addressing the press in Nairobi yesterday K’Oyoo said the company is making the living conditions of his constituents unbearable. “If Kibos Sugar wants to continue with its operations in the area, it must save the environment.” And the Kondele Community Justice Centre chair Boniface Akach accused Nema of aiding in the problem in the area. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko, while on a visit to Kisumu last week, said he will send ministry officials to ensure no untreated water is released to the rivers in efforts to clean Lake Victoria.
