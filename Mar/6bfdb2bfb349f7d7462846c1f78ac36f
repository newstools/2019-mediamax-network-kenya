Bayern Munich travel to Borussia-Park on Saturday to face Borussia Monchengladbach in a massive encounter, pitting second against third in the Bundesliga table. Bayern’s inconsistent first season under Niko Kovac saw the German giants falter during the first half of the season, allowing Borussia Dortmund to claim top spot in the Bundesliga. However, recent good form from the Bavarians, combined with the stuttering form of their arch-rivals, has seen Bayern move within three points of Dortmund. Before Bayern can even contemplate catching Dortmund, there is the small matter of a trip to Monchengladbach to face the Bundesliga’s surprise package of the season. After a disappointing 2017/2018 campaign, Die Fohlen have taken Germany by storm. Led by the scintillating form of Thorgan Hazard, ‘Gladbach sits in third place, firmly in contention for a Champions League berth. Borussia Monchengladbach manager Dieter Hecking will have a relatively full squad at his disposal with the only likely absences being Ibrahima Traore, who continues to face an extended spell on the sidelines following groin surgery, and youngster Michael Cuisance. Niko Kovac will be without long term absentee Corentin Tolisso, who continues to rehab a season ending knee injury. Kingsley Coman will join his French compatriot in the treatment room with a thigh injury, while Saturday will likely come too soon for Arjen Robben as he continues to fight muscular ailments. Saturday’s match will mark the 102nd occasion that these famous German clubs face off in the Bundesliga. Bayern has a clear historical advantage winning 48, drawing 29, and losing just 24 of those clashes. -AFP
