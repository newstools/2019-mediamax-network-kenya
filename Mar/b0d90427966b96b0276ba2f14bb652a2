Anthony Mwangi and Agencies @PeopleDailyKe Thirty six Kenyans lost their lives in the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines plane crash, not 32 as earlier reported, Kenya’s ambassador to Ethiopia Catherine Kamau confirmed yesterday. Kamau said four other Kenyans who held dual citizenship were travelling on passports of other countries but after identification, it was established that they also held Kenyan passports. He, however, declined to reveal the identities of the four but confirmed that their next of kin had been informed. She also said that 33 families who lost their relatives have been registered with the embassy. Two weeks Meanwhile, a service for the victims of the aircrash was held at the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Foreign Affairs Principal secretary Macharia Kamau led the Kenyan delegation. It has also emerged that family members who travelled to Addis Ababa will have to wait for at least another two weeks before burial certificates are processed by the Ethiopian authorities. The Ethiopian Airline is facilitating the victims’ relatives for the duration they will be in the country while the Kenyan embassy is providing logistics for its citizens. Ethiopian Airlines has also offered the relatives of crash victims bags of   soil at the scene of the accident to bury in place of the bodies of their loved ones, reports say. “The soil became an option when it was clear it was difficult to identify bodies to be handed over  to family members,” one family member reportedly said, adding: “We will not rest until we are given the real body or body parts of our loved ones.” According to the BBC, relatives were urged to provide DNA samples either in Addis Ababa or at any of the airlines’ overseas offices. Families have been told it could take up to six months to identify the remains. Several countries have grounded the 737 Max 8 and 9 aircrafts after flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed on March 10.
