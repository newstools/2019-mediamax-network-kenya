Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi A Lands and Environment court in Eldoret has issued conservatory orders stopping the construction of Sh100 million administration block on a disputed piece of land in Uasin Gishu county. The directive byÂ  Justice Anthony Ombwayo will hold until a suit filed by the affected residents is heard and determined. Justice Ombwayo said there was no public participation before the implementation of the project as required by law. Residents of Cheptiret in Kesses constituency filed the suit seeking to halt construction of the office block on the public land accusing the county of failure to involve them. The petitioners argued there was no public participation from the initial stage of the implementation arguing the county was trying to force the project on them.
