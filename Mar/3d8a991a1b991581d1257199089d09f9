Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League entrants Eldonets have set the bar as high as reaching the playoffs in their debut campaign. The Eldoret-based club finally made it to the top tier from Division One (Div 1) last year after five years of trying, having endured a myriad of challenges and now want to make amends by recording impressive performances. “We played Barclays in the Division One quarter-finals and won 2-1 in the best of three series. The win gave us momentum and we went on to beat Kenyatta University and Emyba 3-0 in the best of five semis and finals to lift the trophy and get promoted to the Premier League,” said team captain James ‘Tyson’ Ogwae. Financial boost Their exploits immediately landed the side a sponsor in Platinum Credit who have kitted them and will be responsible for team logistics for a season with the possibility of an extension depending on performance. The company is also in the process of repairing the team’s home court in readiness for the league. “The sponsorship comes as a huge boost for the team. Our biggest challenge was funding but we are delighted that we will no longer have trouble honouring matches. We have set a target of reaching the playoffs this season. However, a top four finish will guarantee full sponsorship and we will work for that,” added Tyson. Eldonets have acquired the services of three new players with a possible inclusion of Kenyan international Tylor Ongwae currently with Bakken Bears who are playing in the FIBA Europe Cup. “He (Tylor) could be available from May to November and we have registered him as one of our players. He could play for us in that period.  His inclusion will definitely be a big boost to the team,” said Tyson who is Tylor’s sibling.
