Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Team Kenya athletes who represented the country at the Africa Masters Athletics Championships in Tunisia last month have protested over the non-payment of their allowances by the government. Runners in the team that finished second at the Africa Masters Athletics Championships in Rades , Tunisia, are yet to be paid their allowances which amount to Sh2 million one month after returning to the country from the continental fiesta. They said despite asking for their dues there has been no satisfactory answer from the government and Athletics Kenya Masters (AKM) on why they have not been paid. The athletes called on the new Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed to intervene so that they can get paid. “We thank the government for fully facilitating our trip where played our part by bringing glory to the country,” they said. They said despite travelling without being paid they put the country first by being patriotic and refused to get distracted by that shortcoming and put Kenya on the continental map by putting up spirited performance. Gold medallist Kenya comprising of a team of 20 athletes coached by the 1982 World Junior 800m gold medallist Sammy “Skylab” Ruto secured 41 medals which included 31 gold, nine silver and one bronze medal to finish second behind hosts Tunisia which had fielded 180 participants continent at the Nationale de Athletissme Olympic Stadium. “Before we left on February 3, we were told to be patient that our allowances will be banked into our accounts by February 6. We were surprised upon our return that no deposits had been made,” complained a member of the team. They added: “So far we have been asking but unfortunately we have not been given any satisfactory as to why we have not and when we shall be paid.” Team Kenya captain the 2009 Africa heptathlon silver medallist Florence Wasike led by the front by winning four gold medals in 100m hurdles, 400m hurdles, 4x400m and 4x100m relays. Mary Maina also won four gold medals in 100m, 200m (M35), 4x100m and 4x400m relay the same to Charity Wandia in both relays together with 800m and 400m (M35). Caroline Awuor replicated the same feat in the relays, 400m and 200m (M40) for the golden afternoon. Geoffrey Terer won three gold medals in 10km and 21km road races before anchoring the men’s 4x400m relay team to victory.
