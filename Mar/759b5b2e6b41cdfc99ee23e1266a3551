Kisii County Assembly Leader of Minority James Ondari has accused the Executive of failing to implement projects that have been allocated funds. He threatened to rally residents to boycott paying taxes to compel the county government to implement the projects.Ondari said residents have raised concerns over stalled projects and are pressing MCAs to explain the same. The Boochi Tendere MCA, who spoke at the Assembly on Thursday, said he would start a revolution in his ward to ensure residents shun paying taxes until the projects are implemented. “We are going to start a revolution. They are not going to collect any cent and I will start from my ward until they implement projects in the budget,” Ondari  told House Speaker David Kombo. The remarks came after  nominated MCA Naomi Bosire informed the House of a tendency by the county Executive to fail to comply with the Assembly’s adopted Reports and Resolutions. “The trend of taking resolutions of this House lightly by some Executives is of great concern to all of us,” she said. The MCA said no Executive had presented a report of select committees within 60 days as stipulated by Standing Order 182. Bosire said if the National Assembly passes the Implementation of Government Assurance Bill, 2018, it will make it mandatory to compel the National government and county Executives to act on decisions passed by legislative assemblies. However, some MCAs said their mandate is to oversight work in their wards and it would be unfair for them to rally residents to stop paying taxes. MCAs, including Ibrahim Ombuya (Sengera Bosoti), Samuel Onuko (Boochi Borabu) and Zablon Mokua (Bassi Central) expressed concerns that leaders were not involved in paying contractors, who do shoddy work, making their oversight work difficult.
