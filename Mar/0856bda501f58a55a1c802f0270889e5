Speaking at Compuera Mang’u Girls High School in Juja during a National Mathematics Contest organised by Kenya Mathematics initiative, Wambui (pictured) also known as the human calculator for her prowess in solving mathematical questions off head, said students should not have a negative attitude towards the subject. Reiterating that the subject is applicable in almost all activities in the life, Wambui said players in the education sector should urgently work on inspiring students to embrace the simplicity of the subject. “Mathematics is an every day thing, when you wake up in the morning, you think mathematics on your way to work, you literally apply mathematics in everything you do. There is no life without mathematics. The negative notion should be dwelt with,” she said.
