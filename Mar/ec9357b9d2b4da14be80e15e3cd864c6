Githinji Mwangi Only accredited delegates and journalists will be allowed to access the Devolution Conference venue, Kirinyaga Social Services Executive Linet Wanjiru has said. She urged residents to keep off Kirinyaga University grounds, where the forum kicks off today. She added that delegates, who have paid Sh20,000 accreditation fee, have been issued with a badge which they will use to access the venue. “We are advising people to stay home and follow the proceedings  from their TVs since this will not be a public participation event,” Wanjiru said during a press briefing at the  university yesterday. The move to bar residents from the venue was met with mixed reactions, with some terming it a “waste of resources that will only benefit hotel owners”. Hawkers banned “What is the purpose of Kirinyaga county hosting the conference when one cannot be allowed to attend unless they pay Sh20,000?” said a resident identified as Anne Wanjiku. Vendors were also banned from hawking near the venue. Meanwhile, the Kirinyaga county government has in the last two days distributed free 150,000 condoms to hotels and guest houses ahead of the conference. Public Health county deputy director Peter Irungu said: “This is nothing new when many visitors are expected at a place.” Major hotels in Muranga, Embu, Mwea, Kutu, and Kerugoya are fully booked as demand for accommodation shot up.
