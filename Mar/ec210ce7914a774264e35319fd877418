Veteran marksman Idris Kasmani emerged the overall winner as the Mars Mechanical Engineers Air Pistol March shoot concluded at the Kenya Regiment Rifle Club (KRRC) in Lang’ata at the weekend. Kasmani returned 527 points out of a possible 600 to grab pole position and subsequently win the Cup that was donated by Mars Mechanical Engineers Managing Director Sunny Syan. Shooting with vigour and accuracy, Kasmani recorded a stellar performance in the second session which consigned his closest challenger Guru Gheley to silver medal position. In the junior category which attracted only two entries, Aman Gujral was adjudged the top with 501 points ahead of his younger brother Tejveer Gujral who carded 402 points. Firing five projectiles over 12 rounds, the overall winner in the budding shooters category posted 261 points halfway the competition and registered a slight improvement in the last period with 266. However, it was in the senior men’s category where real action took centre stage with Kasmani’s performance in the second session consigning Guru Gheley to second position. Gheley was ahead of Kasmani by two points in the first subtotal (263), but shot 258 in the second, letting the latter cruise to the top. Bhaveet Chudasama settled for the third place with 516 points, having posted sub 260 in both halves (257 and 259). In the meantime, resilient Marianne Cherotich won the women’s cluster after accumulating 512 points with Aman Gujral being adjudged the top in the junior class with 501 points. Cherotich was not too happy with her score, saying there was disturbing bright natural light at the indoor shooting range which affected her concentration. She beat Linet Owiti (497) and Doreen Okiri (494) to second and third places on the podium. “It was a bit tough to say the least because the positions I took had a different lighting. We’ll see how to go about it and I am positive next shoot’s scores will be much better,” said Cherotich.
