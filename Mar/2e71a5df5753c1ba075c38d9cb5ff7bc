 Importers of a fertiliser consignment lying at a local godown and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji are engaged in a war of words after efforts to retest samples of the commodity aborted twice. Lawyer Paul Muite, who is representing the importers, a Moroccan company, has dismissed remarks by the DPP that the consignment has stayed at the godown for long and is not fresh. He said the government is opposed to fresh testing of the fertiliser because its claim that it contained mercury is baseless. “The government is working with cartels in the agriculture sector to frustrate justice and are against the importation of subsidised fertiliser into the country,” he claimed. Interfered with Muite was reacting to the DDP’s stand on the controversial testing  of 3,500 metric tonnes of fertiliser for mercury, ordered by the court, as the government now insists it has appealed against fresh testing of the consignment. The importers’ lawyer wants the DDP to stop speculating on the results of the aborted testing after the government allegedly failed to collect samples from Bollore Logistics Warehouse in Changamwe constituency, Mombasa. Muite urged Haji to abide by the court orders, adding that they are eager to know the outcome of the fresh testing. He said the consignment remains valid and its quality is intact until the expiry date next year. “The consignment in 65,000 50kg bags of DAP held at a local warehouse has not been interfered with,” said Muite . Lying in warehouse The DPP has, however refuted claims he has disobeyed court orders to collect samples of the fertiliser from the impounded consignment. He said they have appealed against the court order for retesting because the consignment has been lying in the warehouse since last year, and it is not possible to get same results.
