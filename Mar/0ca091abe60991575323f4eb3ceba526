The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has evicted  more than 50 tenants over rent arrears amounting to Sh70 million as it moved to repossess the Hazina Plaza in Mombasa from a private firm. NSSF had leased the building to M/S Techno Holdings Limited for 10 years four years ago but the firm allegedly defaulted on payment of rent. Communications manager Christopher Khisa said the eviction arose from a Court of Appeal ruling issued on February 22. The company has leased the building for Sh27 million annual ly.  “On February 22, we obtained court orders to evict the tenant, who is Techno Holding Limited from this property. Return on investment The company lawyers had asked for a 45-day notice, but the court gave them 21 days which  expired on Friday night,” said Khisa. Khisa said the property belongs to the people who are members of NSSF.  “If Techno Holdings Limited does not pay, it means that people who are contributing to NSSF will not get any interest on their savings, and as we speak, he has not paid for about two years which is in excess of Sh70 million,” he said. NSSF bought the property in October 1994 from Canon Investments at Sh450 million on sale and lease back basis.
