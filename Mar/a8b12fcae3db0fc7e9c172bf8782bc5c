Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Opposition Chief Raila Odinga on Wednesday renewed his push to have a three-tier government, insisting the current 47 counties are too small to compete and marshal internal resources for their development. Raila, who rallied governors to support his bid cautioned that any attempt to stifle the debate for fear of change or merely political expediency will be swept by winds of change. “Formalisation of regionalism will not necessarily mean dismantling of counties as they are today. Council of Governors (CoG) should help us reconsider and debate the need for using envisaged reforms to formalise regionalism in law,” Raila told delegates at the Sixth Annual Devolution Conference at Kirinyaga. Economically viable “The creation of regional blocks is a logical response to dealing with this problem of economies of scale, in enhancing development of counties,” he added. His statements are almost similar to the ones he shared during the Fifth Devolution Conference in Kakamega where he called for adoption of the former Bomas Draft Constitution that divided Kenya into 14 regions, each made up of several districts. Raila then explained that the intention was to create units with the size and population that made them economically viable. But yesterday, the ODM leader reiterated that the devolved units would do better if they were to be grouped in bigger entities like the current six economics blocs.
