Donor funding for family planning services is shrinking raising concerns in the government and among reproductive health actors in the background of rising appetite for modern and usually costly contraceptives. However, according to Joel Gondi, the Head, Reproductive and Maternal Health Services Unit (RHMSU) at the Ministry of Health, negotiations are going on to ensure family planning financing is included in the Universal Health Coverage (UHC). He said this is good news for the poor women who suffer the most in unmet family planning needs. “In the next two weeks, MOH, Council of Governors will convene to discuss how to improve access to contraceptives. However, we are asking county governments to shoulder some of this financial burden by taking care of quality issues and service delivery,” he said at a Nairobi hotel where results of a six-year survey were released.
