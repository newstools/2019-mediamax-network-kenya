Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Two-time Paralympic champion Samuel Muchai has hinted at a switch from the track to the road races after the 2020 summer Games in Tokyo, Japan. Muchai, who made history by becoming the first athlete living with  disability to win the overall Sports Personality of the Year (SOYA) in 2017, feels time is ripe for him to move a step further. The double winner in the T.11 1,500m and 5,000m from the London Paralypics in 2012, a feat he repeated in Rio, Brazil three years ago, is targeting the fourth International Athletics meeting to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, from April 25-27 to act as qualifiers for next year’s Games in Japan. Upgrade “The 5,000m is the highest level on the track for Paralympics and that is why I feel I need to upgrade to the next event. It has been great running and excelling on the track,” revealed Muchai, who won two gold medals at the World Para Athletics Championships in London in 2017. Speaking after finishing his 10km race in last Sunday’s Beyond Zero Half Marathon, the runner who clocked 34.44, in his first race at that category, said: “The course was fair despite running mostly on the track before. I expected hot weather but it was calm majorly.” While lauding the race orgainisers for including Paralympians in the event, the runner, who has had James Boit as his guide for the last decade, however, feels they did not get the recognition they deserved at the function. “Having us (Paralympians) here was awesome, same case for wheelchair athletes and tricycle category, but we should have been allowed to compete amongst ourselves and not with elite athletes. That was a shortcoming in my opinion,” added Muchai who comes from Kitale, in Trans Nzoia County. Muchai, who trains in Nandi Hills, is currently preparing for the National trials slated for this month where Kenya will select a team for the African qualifiers in Morocco.
