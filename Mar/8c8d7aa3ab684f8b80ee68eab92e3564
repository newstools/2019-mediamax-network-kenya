Eric Juma Opposition leader Raila Odinga has urged Kenyans to decide on what direction they want to take in the fight against corruption. Raila said the country in engulfed in a lot of corruption with individuals grabbing public resources and subsequently hurting development. He regretted that those involved in corruption are well known by the public but instead of condemning them, the church warmly welcomes their donations during funds drives despite knowing the source of such monies. “It’s so unfortunate that public taxes meant for development get stolen by influential people in leadership, who are keen on bribing Kenyans ahead of the next elections,” said Raila. Speaking during two separate funerals in Ugenya, Raila, who is also the African Union special envoy for infrastructure and development, said the embezzled monies could help the country improve its infrastructure. He was accompanied by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Senator James Orengo, Ugenya MP Opiyo Wandayi and Otiende Amollo (Rarieda), among others. Raila said those found guilty of corruption allegations should face the consequences alone without dragging their ethnic groups into the matter.
