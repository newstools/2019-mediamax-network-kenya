About 600 public schools in Nakuru are among public entities set to receive title deeds in an ongoing titling process. Nakuru Lands and Physical planning Chief Officer Judy Waihenya said 29,984 titles deeds have been processed out of the targeted 100,000. While releasing a progress report, she said 762 internally displaced persons would benefit from the exercise when verification is completed. Waihenya said 3,800 and 2,200 individual submissions from Naivasha and Nakuru, respectively, have been approved with 24,000 more expected to be done by the end of the exercise. She said out of 122 urban and market centres, 55 have prepared base maps and have undergone surveying process while 14 others have been approved for physical development plans, therefore, the number of parcels awaiting physical development plans stood at 5,252. The Chief Officer further said 1,800 settlement schemes would have their titling process finalised as 7,995 title deeds out of the targeted 9,795 have been processed. “From Kiambogo, 357 have been submitted for titling while Sirikwa and Mihang’o areas are expected to submit several settlement scheme parcels for titling,” she said. Addressing the press in Naivasha on Friday, Waihenya said the county was conducting public participation and sensitisation meetings to ensure all residents benefit from the programme. This came as Governor Lee Kinyanjui said the county had embarked on  reclaiming all grabbed public land in the area.
