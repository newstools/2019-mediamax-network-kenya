Irene Githinji @gitshee British High Commissioner Nic Hailey has supported ongoing efforts to fight graft, saying those found guilty of the offence must be punished. The envoy also recommended that their assets be confiscated altogether. He said any leader or county official indicted for corruption should step aside while their case is determined to avoid interfering with investigations. “Corruption is stealing from the Kenyan people. The UK welcomes government commitment  to root it out. Those guilty of corruption must go to jail and have their assets confiscated. Only this will convince the Kenyan people that its leaders are serious,” said Hailey when he addressed delegates in the ongoing devolution conference in Kirinyaga, yesterday.
