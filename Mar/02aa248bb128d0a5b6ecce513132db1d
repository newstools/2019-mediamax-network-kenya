Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Controversial businessman Joseph Waswa yesterday defended sacked Sports Cabinet secretary Rashid Echesa, saying he was unfairly targeted for being his friend. Addressing a press conference in Nairobi, Waswa said detectives probing his alleged involvement in a swindling racket that conned businessman Naushad Merali Sh10 million by mimicking President Uhuru Kenyatta’s voice, should desist from linking Echesa to his troubles. In the Friday Cabinet re-organisation, Echesa was fired and replaced by Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed. In Amina’s place, Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) chairman George Magoha was nominated to head the docket. Serious reason Echesa served as Sports CS for slightly over a year having been appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta on January 26, last year. According to  Waswa, if the government wanted to fire Echesa, they could have used a more serious reason rather than “fake allegation”. “They have gone further to associate me with innocent Sports minister  Echesa sacking him on mere allegations that he is known to me and we speak on phone frequently,” said Waswa who was accompanied by his co-accused Isaac Wanyonyi and city lawyer Cliff Ombeta. At the same, Waswa lamented that his life was in danger as cars suspected to be officers from the DCI were constantly following him together with his co-accused Wanyonyi.
