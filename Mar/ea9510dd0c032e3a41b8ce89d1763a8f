Zachary Ochuodho @Zachuodho Fuliza, an overdraft facility on M-Pesa introduced in November last year is expected to lend up to Sh100 billion by the end of this year, Metropol Corporation analysts have predicted. The credit reference bureau said the instant rise in loans uptake has be made possible due to the financial technology (Fintech) application deployed by banks. Safaricom launched the overdraft facility in partnership with KCB Bank Kenya and Commercial Bank of Africa. With the facility, M-Pesa users can send money or pay for goods and services when they have insufficient funds in their mobile money accounts. Metropol Corporation chief executive officer, Sam Omukoko, said through innovative Fintech application used by commercial banks, lenders will still be able to charge high interest rates as they used to before interest rate capping was adopted in 2016. “With Fintech, commercial banks will be able to disburse loans to consumers at high-interest rates, which makes them get closer to where they used to be in terms of charges due to the high-risk premium of the business,” he said in Nairobi yesterday during a media briefing on the firm’s 2019 Economic forecast. Omukoko said through mobile lending, small and medium enterprises, which have been denied credit facilities by commercial banks due to their perceived risk exposure, will be able to access loans which they use to expand their ventures. He said when Fuliza was introduced, Sh1 billion was borrowed within a week and this increased to Sh8 billion in three weeks. “The question is, what will the credit be used for,” he posed. Most people, he said, will be using Fuliza to grow their businesses as well as for consumption purposes, which in essence will fill the void created by the inability of SMEs to access credit from commercial banks.
