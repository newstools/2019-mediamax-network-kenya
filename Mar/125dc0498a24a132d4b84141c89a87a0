Christchurch, Thursday New Zealand will ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles following the Christchurch attacks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said. The announcement comes less than a week after 50 people were killed at two mosques, allegedly by a lone gunman. Ardern said she expected new legislation to be in place by April 11, saying: “Our history changed forever. Now, our laws will too.” All of the dead have now been formally identified, police have confirmed. News conference Australian Brenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with murder and was expected to face further charges. “Six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand,” Ardern said in a news conference. “Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines.” An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. Ardern said the buy-back could cost up to $138 million, but “that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities”. “Our actions, on behalf of all New Zealanders, are directed at making sure this never happens again,” she said. The prime minister has called the Christchurch attacker a terrorist and said she will not utter his name. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines so they could hold more bullets. Unlawful possession As of Thursday, several weapons have been reclassified as military style semi-automatic firearms, making them harder to buy. – BBC
