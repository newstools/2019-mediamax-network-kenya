Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Three suspected poachers were on Wednesday charged before a Nakuru court with trafficking in elephant tusks worth Sh1.6 million. James Yegon, Amos Lumet and Jacob Rono, appearing before Chief magistrate Josephat Kalo, denied the charges of dealing and being in possession of the eight-kilogramme elephant tusks. Through their lawyer John Ochang’, the three sought to be released on reasonable bond terms. “I wish that the court releases my clients on reasonable bond terms, they are not a flight risk,” said Ochang’. According to the charge sheet, the three were found in possession of the trophies on March 5 at Bontana Hotel in Nakuru town without permits from Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). The suspects faced a second count of trying to sell  the tusks, together with others not before court. They were released on a Sh2 million bond each with a surety of the same amount or a Sh1 million cash bail pending hearing of the case on March 20.
