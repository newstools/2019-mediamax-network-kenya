Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The government wants to start regulating fares charged by Public Service Vehicles (PSV) across the country. Transport Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Chris Obure yesterday said the ministry has prepared amendments to the Traffic and National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Act to provide for regulations of fare tariffs. The amendments, he said, are being scrutinised by the ministry’s legal department and will be ready within two months. Under the amendments, the ministry proposes giving NTSA powers to establish PSV fare tariffs. Kenyans protected Appearing before the National Assembly’s Transport committee chaired by Pokot South MP David Pkosing, Obure said the amendments will give the minister legal mandate of formulating regulations on a formula for establishing the tariffs, review mechanism of the tariffs and penalties to be imposed for non-compliance. The CAS said this will ensure the public is protected from exploitation. Currently, commuters on Nairobi’s Ongata Rongai route pay between Sh100 and Sh300 for a 20km trip while from Nairobi to Nakuru, a distance of 150km, costs about Sh300. “Under the current laws there is no express provision that enables NTSA to regulate the fares charged by PSV operators,” said Obure. According to World Journal of Science Research,  Nairobi residents spend 14 to 30 per cent of their income on transport. “The amendments will ensure effective regulation of fare tariffs by NTSA just as the regulation of petroleum prices by the Energy Regulatory Commission,” said Obure. Bomachoge Borabu MP Zadock Ogutu had sought to know whether there are plans by the government to develop regulations to ensure the fares charged by PSV across the country are prescribed, enforced and regulated to protect consumers from exploitation by operators. Pkosing told the ministry to speed up tabling of the report  to ensure Kenyans are protected from any form of exploitation.
