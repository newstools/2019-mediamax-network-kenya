Mutwiri Muriithi @mutwirimuriithi With increasing negative impacts of climate change and more people living closer to townships and city centres, the face of agribusiness is changing drastically to cope with this development. Entrepreneurs have seen opportunities for future growth in the emerging trend and are moving to tap technology and bring some balance, create jobs and feed the nation while at it. Kenyan firm Goldenscape Group is rising to the occasion to fill the growing need and is targeting the East African market with what is seen as sustainable solutions to unlock the potential of agribusiness. Commercial farming The firm is working with investors through its greenhouses projects to create wealth and feed the world but also help those planning to venture into commercial farming to maximise on their returns. Group Chairman Peter  Wangai says agribusiness is the future of this country, and Goldenscape Greenhouses want to show Kenyans that they can farm and make money. To ensure investors have the information on investments, Goldenscape has integrated a system from the greenhouse where investors can log into their credentials and check the progress of their own greenhouse. Adequate irrigation water systems at greenhouse sites, sufficient water reservoirs make it easy to achieve good harvests. This not only offers solutions to ballooning unemployment, given the large cohort of young Kenyans currently entering the labour market, but also offers investors opportunities. These agribusiness initiatives by Goldenscape are uniquely positioned to absorb worker amid little policy on making farming a solution to the challenges of job creation. Six months Goldenscape has introduced lease a greenhouse concept through which entrepreneurs with no land can invest and get their returns on investments after every six months or up to three years.
