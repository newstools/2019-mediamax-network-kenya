Sophie Njoka The collection of signatures to dissolve Mombasa county government has intensified with more than 50,958 signatures collected since the drive was launched by a Mombasa lobby four days ago. According to a report released by ‘Operation Fagia Bunge’ secretary general Mgandi Kalinga yesterday showed that already the plan to collect over 200,000 signatures in four weeks was ongoing well. According to the report, Kisauni is leading with 10,537 signatures followed by Mvita with 10,081, Likoni (9,452), Changamwe (8,059), Nyali (8,193) and Jomvu (4,636). Better services “It’s four days since Mombasa residents embarked on the exercise that will see the house dissolved as a way of demanding better service delivery. Over 50,000 people have signed the petition to dissolve the county Assembly,” read a statement. Kalinga said the exercise would continue in Likoni, Kisauni, Mvita, Changamwe, Jomvu and Nyali to ensure ward representatives were sent packing after failing their oversight role. He said he was hopeful within the next three weeks, they will have collected over 200,000 signatures to enable them to forward the petition to President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Senate to dissolve the Assembly. Frustrations This comes as Governor Joho and Speaker Kharub Khatri are set to appear before the Senate Devolution and inter-departmental committee today over what the lobby termed as MCAs’ bid to frustrate Joho administration.
