Kenyan stars Greg Snow and veteran Dismas Indiza are among 14 pros and six amateur local golfers who will battle it out with some of the best in the world for a share of €1.1 million (Sh124 million) Magical Kenya Open prize money at Karen Country Club starting today. The two have been impressive in the qualifying tour, Safari Open, since its launch in August 2018 with Snow emerging top at the end of the campaign while Indiza came in second. While Snow heads to the tour in top form and having managed scores that could win the Kenya Open, including a -13 at Muthaiga, Mumias long-hitter Indiza brings years of experience at the tournament that joined the European Challenge Tour in 1991. Also on the list of Kenyans having a go at the European Tour event is the most successful home player in the history of the championship Jacob Okello. Top talents Okello came close to winning the event in 1998 when he finished second. He was not done yet as he again raised the hopes of Kenyans in 2006 and 2007 where he came short to finish tied fourth and fifth respectively. Kenya Open officially became a European Tour event this year and with it came a relatively strong field. Many of the golfers who were in action in Doha, Qatar last week are in Kenya, despite the Players Championship, the highest prize fund tournament in golf, taking place in Florida this week, thus attracting top tier talents. This year sees the return of 2015 Kenya Open champion Haydn Porteous, 2016 winner Sebastian Soderberg and title holder Lorenzo Gagli. “It’s amazing to come back to Kenya. I have a lot of good memories from last year so I’m really excited to play here again. The prize, giving was really fun last year, there was a lot of people and the President of Kenya,” said Gagli yesterday. Doha champion Justin Harding is also in action and so are compatriots Erik Van Rooyen, George Coetzee and Christiaan Bezuidenhout who all tied for second over the weekend in Qatar.
