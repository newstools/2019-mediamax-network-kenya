Corruption could  soon be classified  as  a capital offense if an amendment to the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes succeeds. The Bill, sponsored by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro (pictured), seeks to remove the cap set on fines and put them at two times the sum of the amount stolen. In the amendment Bill, Nyoro seeks to have Section 48 which puts fines for offenders at not less than one million shillings, or to imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years, or both deleted. In essence the proposed law means that it will now be the discretion of the respective Judge or magistrate to determine the jail term or fines, meaning the term can also be life imprisonment. Nyoro explains that the principal object of the Bill is to amend the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act in order to prescribe a minimum penalty to act as deterrence for persons who engage in convicted of an offence under the Act. “As it is presently, a person convicted of an offence under the Act is liable to a fine not exceeding one million shillings and a jail term of ten years which I find to be too lenient,” wrote Nyoro.
