A Nairobi tycoon, Mohan Galot, is facing several criminal charges relating to the control of a multi-billion-shilling business. He appeared before Milimani Senior principal magistrate Peter Ooko and denied nine counts of making a document without authority, uttering a false document and giving false information to a person employed in a public office. Galot was charged after High Court judge Luka Kimaru directed that the case, before the trial court, commence immediately. The charges against him include making a false document namely notification of change of directors and secretaries of King Woollen Mills Limited Company on January 18, 2002, with intent to defraud. Ooko fixed April 18 for pretrial conferencing of the matter and June 26 as the hearing date.
