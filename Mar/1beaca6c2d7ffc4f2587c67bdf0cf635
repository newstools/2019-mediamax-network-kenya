Controversial international goalkeeper Wycliffe Kasaya has been dropped by SportPesa Premier League side Posta Rangers, less than three months after joining them. Veteran Kasaya, who has featured for most of the top sides in the local league including Gor Mahia, Sofapaka, AFC Leopards and Mathare United in a 15-year career, is among eight players dropped by the mail men as they restructure with the aim of finishing the current season on a high. “Kasaya has a pending case with his former club Sofapaka and it is risky to give him a contract before the case ends,” said Rangers’ Team Manager John Wakhu. Disciplinary  issues International defender Wesley Onguso, who joined the side in January from league champions Gor Mahia, has also been released after a dip in form and so is Levis Opiyo who has been dropped reportedly due to disciplinary  issues. “Gilbert Osonga, Lewis Ndichu, Brian Juma, Peter Kamau and Ray Omondi who have also been discarded because of poor performance. We have, however, only made a single signing in goalkeeper Martin Lule from National Super League side St Joseph’s,” added Wakhu. Kasaya sought legal redress at Football Kenya Federation’s Player Status Committee in January after his two-year contract, which was to expire on May 31 2020, was terminated at the end of last season, barely four months after joining Batoto Ba Mungu. The federation felt that he had a genuine case and ordered Sofapaka to pay him Sh1.6 million, just for the 2009 Premier League champions to appeal
