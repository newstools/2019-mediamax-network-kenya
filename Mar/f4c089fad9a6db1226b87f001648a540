Brian Musyoka @PoeopleDailyKe Soccer fans  in Embu county are mourning the death of former Kenya Football Federation secretary general Hussen Swaleh who was among those who died on Sunday  following the ET320 plane crash at Bishoftu in Ethiopia. Led by businessman Mugo Mate, the fans said Kenya had lost a committed and talented player.  Mugo said Swaleh’s enthusiasm inspired him to love football. “I lack words to express myself. The gap Swaleh has left in football both locally and internationally is too big to be filled,” he said. Swaleh served as Kenya Football Federation secretary general between 2000 and 2004. He was initially elected deputy secretary but took over as secretary general shortly after. During his term, he  managed to see Kenya reach the Africa Cup of nations in Tunisia where they delivered a 3-0 victory against Burkina Faso.
