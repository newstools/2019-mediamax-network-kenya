Supremacy battles between Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and Senator Kimani Wamatangi has thwarted plans to establish a county development committee. County commissioner Wilson Wanyanga said it has negatively impacted on general development of the area. Speaking when he joined area MP Githua Wamacukuru in laying the foundation stone for the Kabete sub-county headquarters at Wangige on Wednesday, Wanyanga said he would soon convene a meeting with leaders in the county to iron out differences between the two leaders. He said  it would be prudent for leaders to work as a team for the sake of development noting that working together would avoid duplication of projects which leads to loss of public resources. “We can’t allow differences between two leaders to affect development of the county,” said Wanyanga. Meanwhile, Wamatangi has challenged  Waititu to complete all stalled projects initiated by his predecessor,William Kabogo. He said it would be a waste of public resources if Waititu continued starting new projects at the expense of those initiated by the former governor. Citing projects such as the Limuru and Githunguri fire stations and the Dagoretti open-air market, the senator said millions of shillings would be lost if the projects are not completed. “Stalled projects is a pointer to poor planning which results in cost variations and failure to achieve value for money,” said the senator when he spoke to People Daily yesterday.
