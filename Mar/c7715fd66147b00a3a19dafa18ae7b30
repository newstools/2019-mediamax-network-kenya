Bernard Gitau @benagitau Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa yesterday admitted the man acused of defrauding a city businessman by impersonating President Uhuru Kenyatta is his personal friend. Echesa, however, denied claims he is in business partnership with Joseph (Henry) Waswa, who was recently charged alongside six others for conning Sameer Group chairman Naushad Merali Sh10 million after impersonating the President. Waswa has also been linked to another scandal involving Sh32 billion fake currency and 70kg of fake gold, the trade alleged to be aided by Echesa. Enemies at work Waswa’s other colleagues were William Simiyu, David Luganya, Gilbert Kirunja, Duncan Muchai, Isaac Wajekeche and Anthony Wafula. “Waswa is a friend to many politicians, including myself but he is not a business partner,” said Echesa. Echesa denied involvement in money laundering and accused “political enemies” of driving propaganda against him. “I will sue anyone who accuses me of money laundering,” he told People Daily. The youthful CS also shrugged off claims he could be privy to the underhand dealings of Waswa. “What is wrong with me being a friend to somebody? Does that mean I involve myself in everything he does? After all Waswa is a friend to several high-ranking politicians in this country,” Echesa said. Counterfeit His sentiments came a day after detectives in Nairobi confiscated fake money amounting to Sh32.6 billion in assorted currency and counterfeit gold in a residential house in Ruiru. Waswa, who wears many hats—youth entrepreneur and politician with powerful political and social connections—together with his friends were released on a Sh100,000 cash bail each. It is alleged Waswa, who was arrested last Friday, had attempted to seek Echesa’s intervention in the matter. According to sources, Waswa may have been in the company of Echesa at popular joint in Lavington at the time he was arrested on Friday.
