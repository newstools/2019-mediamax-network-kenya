Judy Wangui Mungai and Michael Githae Mathenge were yesterday charged with the murder of 39-year-old Kiambu businesswoman Mary Wambui Kamangara in January. The court heard that between January 26 and 27, jointly with others not before the court, at the Fourways Junction Estate on Kiambu-Nairobi road, they murdered Wambui. Wangui is believed to be Wambui’s husband Joseph Kori’s lover while Mathenge is a car-hire businessman. They denied the charges before Kiambu High Court judge Christine Meoli. Prosecution counsel Christine Ndombi opposed the duo’s application to be released on bond. The bond request hearing will be heard on March 18. Set free Yesterday, the court also set the pre-trial conference of the case for July 30 while the hearing was set for October 7 and 8. The gruesome murder of Wambui, who was buried on Saturday last week at her husband’s rural home in Mweiga, Nyeri, shook the nation. Her husband, Kori, had been initially arrested with Wangui, but later set free after police said there was no evidence linking him to the murder. Wangui is alleged to have lured  Wambui into her house before killing her by hitting her on the head nine times with a blunt object and later dumping her body in a dam in Juja. Employee Earlier that day, the two had reportedly enjoyed meals and drinks at a Thika Superhighway restaurant in the company of two men. Reports indicate that Wangui and Wambui were known to each other with the former having been an employee of Kori in one of his businesses. During Wambui’s burial, an emotional Kori was not able to read his tribute and a friend had to do it on his behalf. Wambui, 39, left behind two sons.
