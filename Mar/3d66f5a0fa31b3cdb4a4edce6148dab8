Tell us about yourself My name is Charles Kariuki. I am 13 years old and in Class Six at Naro Moru Township Academy. When did you get into conservation? It all began in Class Four. The headteacher came with the idea of starting a club on conservation and environment. I was a member for two months then I left. Later on, my Kiswahili teacher, who was the patron of the club, encouraged me to join, and I became the chairman. What does being the chairman involve? I control the club’s projects, and also organise the members and give them instructions on our ventures. Is it a challenging role? Yes. I’ve lost so many friends, as some are jealous of my position in school. Others are hard headed and can’t be told what to do. What activities does your club do? We sell seedlings and we use the money we make to visit farms and learn about their operations. We also sensitise others on the importance of conserving the environment and our trees. How do you balance your role and schoolwork? Being a chairman enables me to work around my time, so, I can always call for meetings and do projects when we are free. What’s your favourite subject? Social studies and CRE, as I love questions on the Bible. What would you like to be in future? An astronomer. Really? Why? There was a time I heard scientists were researching on whether there’s life in Mars. I just want to explore and find out if its true. You were awarded a mountain bike by the Mount Kenya trust for your efforts in conservation. How did that make you feel? Very happy. I’ve always desired a mountain bike, and this motivated me to push even harder and plant more trees. How do your parents support what you do? They encourage me to continue with conservation, and also pay for what I need, as well as buying me books to learn more on conservation. Advice to other kids? It’s not too late to conserve the environment. Nature will protect you as you protect it, so preserve it.
