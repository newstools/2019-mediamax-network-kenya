Police officers serving at Kilingili police station in Vihiga county where six night guards were killed on Saturday night have been transferred. County commissioner Susan Waweru said the officers had  been moved and new ones redeployed in a bid to beef up security. She assured residents that security had been reinforced adding that night patrols had been intensified. Waweru urged residents to work with law enforcement officers to provide relevant information to  help apprehend criminals who killed the night guards. Emerging from a crisis security meeting yesterday, the county commissioner said investigations have been launched into the macabre Saturday night incidence. “We resolved to reshuffle police officers as one measure of addressing insecurity. We have a raft of measures to conclusively address the matter,” said Waweru. Deputy governor Patrick Saisi said the county government will assist the bereaved families by settling the funeral costs. Women Representative Beatrice Adagala urged the new  police officers to work with the community to prevent loss of lives and property.
