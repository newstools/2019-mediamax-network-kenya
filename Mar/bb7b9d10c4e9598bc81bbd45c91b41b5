Musa Radoli @PeopleDailyKe The Nairobi County government has committed more than Sh80 billion to construct new modern retail markets at strategically-chosen locations across the city to boost trade as well as increase revenue collection from markets. Other projects targeted for strategic locations is the construction of new five fire stations out of the city’s central business district (CBD) closer to residential estates to provide faster services. “Some of these projects are already in progress with several nearing completion. The work on  fire stations is 90 per cent done, that one of Waithaka is 70 per cent done as well as Mwaliro market,” said Nairobi governor Mike Sonko (pictured). Growing population Sonko said most of the retail markets in the city were built in on or before the 1960s  therefore, they are old and their stalls and design do not meet the demands of today’s Nairobi with an ever growing population. “We want to change that” he added. “Even if we have to destroy the old markets and residential houses to construct new modern structures and in the process inconvenience some people, we are determined and focused,” he said adding: “I want to warn those who resist or carry individual business interests, we will not condone them.” He, however, said that those who will be affected will be compensated. The county government is also planning to construct more than 200,000 houses targeting low and middle class owners in the next five years.
