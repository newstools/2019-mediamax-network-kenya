by Nancy Gitonga @PeopleDailyKe Former Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo will now pay Sh660,000 fine or serve a year in jail after the High Court revised her sentence. Justice John Onyiego sentenced her afresh yesterday noting that the trial had erred in law by sending her to jail for two years without the option of a fine even after the money that Gwendo had allegedly stole had been fully paid. New conditions Justice Onyiego set the new conditions after he said  High Court had powers to set aside the two-year jail term imposed on Gwendo by trial Magistrate Douglas Ogoti for stealing Sh1.7 million on December 7 last year. “It was wrong for the trial magistrate to impose a jail term without the option of a fine,” ruled Onyiego. The court also considered the fact that in the plea bargain, which she failed to honour, there was no provision for compensation.  The judge said Ogoti was wrong by failing to state reasons for failing to give her the option of a fine.
