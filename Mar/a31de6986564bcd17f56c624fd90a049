 People who invested in the troubled Ekeza Sacco will be paid their savings in the next 60 days after a court cleared its management to resume office. “In 60 days, we will be calling members for their savings starting from those with Sh5,000 and below. We will later pay those with Sh20,000 and below until we pay the last member who wishes to withdraw their savings,” said Sacco founder David Ngari (pictured). It also emerged that a South African investor has partnered with the Sacco to boost its investments. “A South African investor has joined us. All issues concerning investors and all liabilities will be solved amicably,” he added. Restraining order The crisis-stricken Sacco got a lifeline after Milimani Commercial Courts issued a restraining order against the government’s decision to remove the Sacco’s management committee. On March 13, senior resident Magistrate Isaac Orenge restrained the Commissioner of Co-operatives Development from removing the management committee pending hearing and determination of the suit. The court temporarily barred the commissioner from installing a new management Committee. The Sacco has been in the  news over alleged loss of members saving amounting to Sh1.5 billion. The Director of Criminal Investigations has summoned Ngari and other officials to record statements over possible fraud.
