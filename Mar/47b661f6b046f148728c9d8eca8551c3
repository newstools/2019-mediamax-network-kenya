Britain and Germany have joined a growing list of nations banning Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets from flying in their airspace in the wake of the Ethiopian air disaster. Aviation chiefs in the two countries took action after an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed minutes after take off on Sunday killing all 157 on board – the second disaster involving a MAX 8 model in under five months. They join Australia, Singapore, China, Malaysia and Oman in grounding the jets. Major airlines from North America to the Middle East have, however, continued to fly the aircraft. Tui Airways has the only five 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by a UK-based airline, and confirmed the planes have been grounded following the CAA’s decision. Norwegian Air, the other major operator of MAX 8s in the UK, confirmed they too had suspended flights with the jets following a recommendation from European aviation authorities. It comes as pressure continues to mount on Boeing after more airlines and countries grounded their fleets of 737 MAX 8 jets and as shares in the firm crashed for the second time in two days with $20 billion (Sh2 trillion) wiped off the firm’s value. – Agencies
