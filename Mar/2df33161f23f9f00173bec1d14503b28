By Barry Obel Shabana and Nairobi Stima shared the spoils as they drew 1-1 at Gusii Stadium in an enthralling clash to see the visitors maintain their unbeaten run. Hamisi Ahadi opened the account for ‘Tore Bobe’ with a neat shot outside the box in the 33rd minute while Victor Omune leveled the scores inside 56 minutes to keep them at pace with the leading pack on 38 points. Elsewhere, Hillary Otieno hit a glorious brace to help rampaging Administration Police thrash visiting Eldoret Youth 3-0 at Camp Toyoyo. This came as a relief for a team that had gone for three matches without a win; thus moving them to sixth on the log with 28 points. It was also a game that was physically contested from both ends but tactically AP were dominant. AP started off with a bang dominating possession with skipper Etemesi Asumwa, Abbas Abdulkarim and Wycliffe Wafula being lively upfront. Twice in the opening 15 minutes Otieno skewed chances with goalkeeper Richard Edenyo well beaten. In the 30th minute however, speedy Otieno was quick to react to a well connected pass from the left flank off Mokuya Riro to stab home the opener with the opposing defence caught napping. Inside 40 minutes, Otieno scored his second; a low shot from the edge of the box. Second half was a bit balanced but substitutions done by AP were spot on. Salim Mzee and Alfred Chole were immediately creating impact but were constantly unlucky or wasteful upfront. Late in the 84th minute, Chole ran onto a loose ball and his pressure paid as the goalkeeper spilled the ball to his path for an easy tap. Meanwhile lowly Green Commandoes cause the biggest upset of the day with a 2-1 win over high riding Kisumu Allstars at their Bukhungu Stadium. Another shocker came in the frame of Migori Youth who beat Nairobi City Stars 1-0 courtesy of Mark Osewe’s 13th minute strike.
