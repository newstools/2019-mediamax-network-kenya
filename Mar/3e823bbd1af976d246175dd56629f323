Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga Thirteen African countries have resolved to speed up the ratification of the Unesco convention of 2001 for the protection of the underwater archaeological heritage on sea line. Kenya is leading the implementation of the pact and is already planning to establish the institute of underwater archaeology in the Coastal region which will be the only one in Eastern Africa region. Proper training The resolution aimed at protecting underwater heritage, was arrived at during a conference that brought together ministers from the East African Countries in Malindi, Kilifi county. During the meeting, it was resolved that the government officials should initiate the process of signing the convention. It emerged that only one country in East Africa has signed the convention. A report on the implementation of the resolution will be tabled in June during the Unesco convention in Paris. Chief Administrative Secretary for Sports and Culture Hassan Noor said their aim is to ensure the process takes the shortest time possible. He said they agreed to begin proper training of underwater archaeologists. “Kenya will take the lead by coming up with the first under water archaeology training institute which will be set up at the Coast,’’ he said. Minute of silence He said under water cultural heritage has not been tapped despite the fact there is a lot of history along the 3,000-kilometre ocean stretch from Somalia to Mozambique. Participants in the conference observed a minute of silence in honour of renowned under water archaeologist Sebastino Tusa who perished in the Ethiopian Airline tragedy that claimed 157 lives.
