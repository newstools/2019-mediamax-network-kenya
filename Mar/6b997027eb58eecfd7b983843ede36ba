Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied workers (Kudheiha) has issued a 30-day strike notice to the management of public universities over unfulfilled Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) of 2017-21. “We have been trying to negotiate to solve this issue but universities have been making it hard for us. We are worried that this may be creating a recipe for industrial disharmony in the universities,”  Kudheiha secretary general Albert Njeru said. Meanwhile, the union welcomed the appointment of Prof George Magoha as the Education Cabinet secretary saying they have confidence in him to propel the sector to next level.
