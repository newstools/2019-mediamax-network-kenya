Khartoum, Wednesday A state of emergency imposed across Sudan is restricting public freedoms, a minister said Wednesday, as lawmakers discussed the measure imposed by President Omar al-Bashir to quell anti-government protests. Bashir declared a year-long state of emergency on February 22 after an initial crackdown failed to suppress deadly demonstrations against his iron-fisted rule stretching back three decades. “The imposing of a state of emergency has a negative impact … because it restricts public freedoms,” Minister of Justice Mohamed Salim told parliament as he tabled the presidential order for lawmakers’ approval. “We hope that the reasons for which the state of emergency has been imposed end soon.” Lawmakers are to vote on it on March 11. The parliament is expected to approve the state of emergency as Bashir’s ruling National Congress Party has an overwhelming majority in the 428-member assembly. Deadly clashes have rocked Sudan since December 19 when protests erupted after a government decision to triple the price of bread. -AFP
