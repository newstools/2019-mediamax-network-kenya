Seth Onyango @SethManex Some Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leaders have thrown their weight behind former MP Irshad Sumra ahead of  the Embakasi South by-election slated for April 5. The seat fell vacant after the Supreme Court nullified the election of the immediate former area legislator Julius Mawathe. Yesterday, MPs George Aladwa (Makadara), Tim Wanyonyi (Westlands), Geoffrey Otsotsi  (nominated), Busia Woman Rep Florence Mutua and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala assured Sumra of support. Neutral leader In a meeting presided over by ODM,  secretary general Edwin Sifuna called on Luhyas in the constituency to vote for Sumra. “We have more than 23,000 votes in Embakasi South and we will ensure than all these votes go to Sumra. We want a leader who will address the challenges facing most residents in the constituency,” said Sifuna. Aladwa echoed Sifuna’s sentiments asserting Sumra is the most neutral candidates that will unite all the tribes in the constituency. He promised opponents a bruising battle even as Sumra exuded confidence that he will win the by-election. Wanyonyi announced that Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress (ANC) have also agreed to support Sumra in the by-election.
