Paul Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKe Laikipia County government will reduce its workforce to cut the ever increasing wage bill that currently stands at Sh2.7 billion. Workers salaries and personal emoluments amount to more than 55 per cent, higher than the development allocation which stands at Sh1.2 billion in this financial year’s budget. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said  legally, the wage bill should be more than 35 per cent of the county’s budget. The Public Finance Management Act requires that personal emoluments should not be more than 35 per cent of the total budget. In his plan to streamline the public service, the governor said he intends to have fewer employees tasked with more duties. Street cleaners will be required to also be parking attendants and revenue collection supervisors at the places surrounding their area of work. “Doctors who decide to go on study leaves will have to be relieved of their duties from the county and hence they will not be drawing salaries from the county government,” noted Muriithi.
