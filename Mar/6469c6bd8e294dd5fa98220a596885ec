Harrison Kivisu and Zuena Halako @PeopleDailyKe The row between Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and some MCAs took a new turn yesterday after activists held demonstrations demanding dissolution of the county government. The activists under “Operation Fagia Bunge” said they plan to collect 200,000  signatures starting March 12 to petition the President to form a commission of inquiry on the wrangles, with an aim of dissolving Mombasa County government. Misuse of funds Led by lobby chairlady Mary Oyier and spokesman Mghadi Kalinga, the activists accused the Assembly of misuse of funds and incompetency. The demonstrations held outside the Assembly come days after Joho threatened to instigate ouster of the ward reps. On Sunday, he claimed MCAs were being used by his detractors to derail his 2022 Presidential bid. Some MCAs had accused Joho’s administration of incompetence.
