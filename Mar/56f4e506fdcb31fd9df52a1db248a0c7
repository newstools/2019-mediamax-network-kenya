Bernard Gitau @benagitau The National Assembly Environment and Natural Resources Committee is mulling  the  possibility of decommissioning Nairobi dam. The committee chaired by Kareke Mbiuki expressed concern on the economic viability of the dam. “We are on an inspection tour of various riparian lands reclaimed by the multi-agency team and want to know the safeness and economic viability of the dam,” said Mbiuki. The dam is at the centre of controversy over its boundary with Seefar Apartment which National Environment Management Authority and Water Resource Management Authority (Warma) had earmarked for demolition last year. But this might receive resistance from environmentalist questioning dam removal to pave way for human settlement. “Sewage tributaries are polluting the river hence should be addressed by addressing sewer challenge from upstream going downstream contrary to what is going currently,” said Mbiuki.
