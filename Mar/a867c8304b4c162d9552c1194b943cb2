Best thing about being Kenyan? Kenya is my home and the beauty of it is we have  43 tribes, which brings the aspect of diversity. I love being Kenyan also because of our cultural differences. One thing that many people don’t know about you? That I am a vegetarian. Also most people do not know that I am an organic farmer. Memorable country you have ever been to? Italy. It’s one of the best countries as I got to interact with president Sergio Mattarella over a good meal. There is also a city in Italy known as Venice and it is covered with water, the experience was just amazing. Sweetest act anyone has ever done for you? A friend once bought for me a King James Bible. I was touched to say the least. Favourite hotel in town? Ole Sereni because it is in the outskirts of Nairobi, quite accessible, has privacy and their food is astounding. Best advice you have ever received? It’s actually a verse from the Bible, Psalms 25, “Let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.” Best childhood memories? My dad used to take me for fishing at Adhi Kucha. I always enjoyed it. Best way to relax? Listening to some gospel music and sermons. Hardest decision you have ever made in your life? Settling as an organic farmer. It was quite challenging because people have different perceptions. Hitting the market was also a challenge, but with time things got better. Lowest moment in your life? When I lost my first business, wheat farming due to the 2013 post-election violence. I was also a fruit supplier and I lost a lot of money.
