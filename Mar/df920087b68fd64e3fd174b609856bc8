Some Amani National Congress (ANC) MPs now want Deputy President William Ruto to record a statement with investigating agencies on what he knows concerning the Sh21 billion dam scandal. The lawmakers, in a press conference at Parliament buildings, said Ruto appeared to have vital information, which would help investigators to unearth the scam. Led by Lugari MP Ayub Savula, who is also the Deputy Party Leader, the legislators said anyone in the know, regardless of his public standing, must provide evidence to investigators. “The DP has done a noble thing by revealing the amount of money lost in the said scam. He should, therefore, do the honourable thing and name the individuals involved,” said Savula. Savula asked the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to lead the way and step down to pave the way for investigations against him to be completed. However, another group of ANC lawmakers led by Godfrey Osotsi (nominated) accused their colleagues of being hypocrites, who have no mandate to lecture on graft matters. Osotsi accused the MPs of  attributing runaway corruption to the Handshake, saying were it not for the gesture the scandals may not have been exposed. “Where were they when money was being stolen, they cannot pretend to be public gatekeepers while they watched when the public coffers were being looted,” said the MP. Savula, who was accompanied by colleagues Alfred Agoi (Sabatia), Beatrice Adagala (Vihiga Woman Rep) and Ernest Kivai (Vihiga) asked President Uhuru Kenyatta not to spare his close allies named in graft-related scandals. The Savula-led group dismissed the Handshake, saying instead of helping tackle the corruption menace it had instead helped in opening up new fronts for the high and mighty to steal from the taxpayer. “We have had enough of the Handshake, we want to see action, we want to see people bearing their crosses, no more talk,” the MPs said in a statement.
