Washington, Monday President Donald Trump said Sunday that the congressional questioning last week of his former lawyer may have contributed to the failure of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — even as his national security advisor claimed the Hanoi meeting was a success. Open hearings A high-stakes second summit to strike a disarmament deal with Kim broke up in disarray in Vietnam Thursday, with Trump saying: “Sometimes you have to walk and this was just one of those times.” The summit took place at the same time a Democrat-led congressional committee was grilling Michael Cohen (pictured), Trump’s former lawyer, who labelled his former boss a “racist”, “conman”, and “cheat”. “I know who Trump is. A racist, conman and cheat,” he said last week. On Sunday, Trump said the hearing may have contributed to the “walk”. “For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the ‘walk’,” he tweeted. National interest “Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!” Still, US National Security Advisor John Bolton told CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday that the summit should be seen as “a success, defined as the president protecting and advancing American national interests.” He said the issue was whether North Korea would accept what the president called “the big deal” — denuclearizing completely — or something less, “which was unacceptable to us.” “So the president held firm to his view. He deepened his relationship with Kim Jong Un. I don’t view it as a failure at all when American national interests are protected,” Bolton added. —AFP
