Mukalo Kwayera @kwayeram Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i yesterday led hundreds of friends, relatives, colleagues and students of former Pangani Girls’ High School Principal, Pacifica Nyambongi, in paying tributes to the departed educationist who passed away on Thursday last week. Matiang’i, who also conveyed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s message of condolence, described the fallen tutor as a towering point of reference and wisdom and a hard worker, who epitomised excellence and extolled virtues of discipline and honesty. “She was in her own class. She was a highly gifted servant of the people. She set the standards so high that all of us are today very proud of her and her achievements. She used every opportunity she got to ensure that the larger society benefits from her qualities. said Matiang’i. Nyambongi was a sister to Nakuru Town West MP, Samuel Arama. The 66-year-old Nyambongi joined Pangani Girls from Precious Blood Girls Secondary School in 1991 as the head of Mathematics department.  She was appointed the Deputy Principal in 1999 and later on as Principal in 2002. She retired in 2015. Nyambongi will be buried today in Keroka, Kisii county.
