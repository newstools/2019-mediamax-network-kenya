Former Harambee Stars coach Stanley Okumbi is set to make a return to club football, three years after leaving Mathare United to take over the national team. Okumbi, much-maligned during his stint at Stars, is set to be roped in as the new technical director of struggling SportPesa Premier League side AFC Leopards with Chemelil Sugar tactician Francis Baraza being considered for the assistant coach’s position. Sources privy to the ongoings at the Den told People Sport that the team’s long-serving technical director Tom Juma is set to be axed with Okumbi replacing him as Ingwe try to improve their fortunes after a poor run of form that has seen them win just three matches this season, to stay in position 16 on the 18-team table. “We are expecting to strengthen the technical bench and it will be made official in a few days. We are also engaged in discussions with some of the players we have identified that we hope to bring in,” said the source who sought anonymity. He added: “The vacant assistant coach’s role has attracted 12 highly-qualified coaches and we are zeroing in on the one we believe will add great value to the team as we embark on a serious programme to that will get us back to winning ways.” Others being mentioned for the assistant coach’s position are current Vihiga United tactician Mike Mururi and former Leopards boss Abdalla Juma who is currently handling National Super League side FC Talanta. With the mid-season transfer window set to open on Monday, Leopards are also preparing to bolster their squad and have already set their sights on former national team defender David ‘Cheche’ Ochieng, Sony Sugar defensive midfielder Abdallah Nankuru, Kakamega Homeboyz winger Noah Wafula and Micheal Khamati (both ex-players) as well as Sofapaka’s attacking midfielder John Avire.
