Irene Githinji @gitshee University of Nairobi (UoN) lecturers yesterday threatened to down tools over claims of mismanagement at the institution. The dons cited the university’s failure to pay emoluments for services offered to self-sponsored students. Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu), UoN Chapter, decried how management was handling issues, claiming some decisions were made with impunity and complete disregard of lecturers’ wellbeing. The university Uasu chairman and secretary Richard Bosire and George Omondi, respectively, condemned the alleged failure to pay the emoluments. Omondi said the university management on Monday unilaterally tabled, at the institution’s Senate, a proposal to review existing policy for compensation of staff offering services to self-sponsored programmes without consulting key stakeholders. Uasu also raised concerns over lack of career progression and alleged unfair retirement criteria for academic staff in the university. The union has since demanded a comprehensive audit of the institution to “take it back to its status as a premier university”. Omondi said lecturers have not been paid up to Sh1 billion, backdated to 2015, yet self-sponsored students have paid fees in full. “The monies must be paid to the beneficiaries with immediate effect as per the current policy and formula for distribution of the said funds,” he said. The union also accused the university of wastage of resources through council meetings and retreats, creation of non-strategic units and positions to reward cronies, among others.
