Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday received his new generation firearm licence in compliance with a directive by Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i. The Firearm Licensing Board chaired by Charles Mukindia requires all licenced firearm holders to undergo fresh vetting and apply afresh by March 18 this year. “Today, I received my new generation firearm licence smart card and certificate from the Firearms Licensing Board after undergoing the due certification process and obtaining a unique identification number,”  the President said. The Firearm Licensing Board will have all details of the firearm holder in a newly developed electronic microchip card. However, Kenyans on social media made fun on the President Twitter post not only because of his compliance status but because he already has enough security detail at his disposal. “If a president needs a firearm, then what do I need??? Thunder???” A social media user posed.
