Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich on Thursday evening had to eat his supper in a room at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters where he was being interrogated over suspected irregular payment of Sh21 billion towards the construction of Arror and Kimwarer dams in Elgeyo Marakwet county. The CS, who arrived at the DCI headquarters at 4pm and stayed until 11pm, had to be served his evening meal at 9.30pm by relatives in the interrogation room. Rotich had been recalled by the detectives in the Serious Crime Unit for the third time to record a statement over the alleged multi-billion-shilling scandal. His lawyer Katwa Kigen, however, downplayed the summons. “We needed to explain something on the relationship between the procurement process, the commercial contract and the facilities agreement which we have done now and left the DCI,” Kigen said shortly after they stepped out of  the interrogation room. But detectives said the areas in Rotich’s statement that required clarification and necessitated him being called back were “weighty”.
