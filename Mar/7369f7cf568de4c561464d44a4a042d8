Kenya Bureau of Standards acting managing director Benard Nguyo was yesterday summoned by a Nairobi court to show cause why he should not be jailed for disobeying orders requiring him to conduct fresh testing of fertiliser suspected to contain mercury. Milimani Principal Magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot said the court was convinced Nguyo (pictured)  deliberately decided not to comply with the orders. “Kebs MD Nguyo is hereby summoned to appear in this court on Tuesday to explain why he should not be punished for contempt of court,” said Cheruiyot. The orders followed an application by Benson Oduor, one of the suspects in the sub-standard fertiliser import case, for a fresh test of the consigment. Oduor, a supervisor with Bolore Transport, through his lawyer Paul Muite, asked the court to jail Nguyo for disobeying orders issued by the court in January 15 for retesting on 5,846,000 kgs of fertiliser alleged to contain mercury. Oduor is charged with Kebs MD Charles Ongwae and seven others over the importation of substandard fertiliser and circulation of fake Kebs stamps.
