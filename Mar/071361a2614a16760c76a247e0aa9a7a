Kinyuru Munuhe @Kinyurumunuhe A bid by Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) Nairobi chairman Richard Ngatia to become the next president of the organisation has received a major boost. This is after delegates from five Mt Kenya counties declared support for him ahead of the national chamber’s presidential position polls set for May. Kiprono Kittony is the outgoing KNCCI president having headed the business lobby for two terms since his election in 2012. The team led by Thinguri Warwathe, Central Kenya KNCCI regional director who doubles as Kiambu County chairman of the chamber said the delegates unanimously voiced their support for Ngatia during a meeting in Sagana yesterday. Track record “We have seen what you have done as the Nairobi Chapter chairman. And going by the track record and support you have received from other regions, we now declare our support for your candidature for the upcoming national elections,” he said. The delegates were drawn from Kiambu, Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua and Nyeri counties. In attendance were chamber representatives from other counties where Ngatia has made inroads rooting support for his quest for the chamber top seat. They include Uasin Gishu, Vihiga, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Laikipia, Nakuru, Garissa, Embu and Bungoma counties. Ngatia said the event was part of meet-the-people tour to sell his agenda to KNCCI members and assure them of appropriate gain for all counties and chamber chapters.
