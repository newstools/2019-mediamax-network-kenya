KINYURU MUNUHE AND WANGU GACHECHE Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji have ordered investigations into the conduct of a driver attached to the latter’s office. Haji confirmed the vehicle is attached to his office. Boinnet directed officers assigned to guard VIPs to stop harassing motorists on the road. “All officers on VIP security duties have therefore been instructed to stop this behaviour. They must follow the highway code and obey traffic rules like other motorists,” he said. The unidentified  driver is accused of  harassing a motorist identified as Serah Waithera Gaitho after hitting her car on Ngong Road Friday. In a social media post, which she tagged the National Police Service, Gaitho said she was hit by the driver of a Toyota Landcruiser Prado registration number KCM 485Y. “I have been hit by these very important people while driving on the wrong side. Please help me find them,” Gaitho tweeted. She also uploaded a photo showing the alleged culprits at the scene of crime. Haji acknowledged that the vehicle belongs to his office and promised to inform the public on the progress of the case. “The matter has been brought to the attention of the DPP. The motor vehicle belongs to the ODPP and the DPP has directed that immediate action be taken by the National Police Service against the driver involved,” said Haji. Gaitho said the driver of the vehicle only examined the damage to her car and left without offering any help or apology. Her attempt to report the matter to the police did not help either. According to her, the officers asked her to hand over the driver when she arrests him. “I reported to the cops and this is what they had to say: ‘ukiwashika tuambie (let us know once you arrest them)’”, she tweeted. But yesterday, Haji asked the police to take immediate action against the driver.
