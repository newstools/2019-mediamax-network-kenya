Kiambu county has bagged the lion’s share of the Sh30 billion that the World Bank has doled to different counties in form of grants to improve infrastructure of rapidly growing towns. While other counties will receive at least Sh200 million under the grant, advanced through the Ministry of Infrastructure and Housing to develop urban areas, Kiambu’s largest share was informed by the fact that it has six major growing towns and enjoys a relatively large population. The county will receive Sh1.9 billion per year for the next six years most of which will be channelled to development projects in Kikuyu sub-county which is the most populous in the county. Speaking while launching storm water drainage system project at Landless in Thika, Governor Ferdinand Waititu  (pictured) said that he has instituted a competent team to manage the municipalities maintaining that they will not duplicate other government functions. He said most of municipalities’ board members have wealth of experience to manage the grant well. County Lands executive James Maina said the  project which has been allocated Sh50 million will be completed  in eight months.
