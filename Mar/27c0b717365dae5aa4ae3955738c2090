Turkana leaders have asked residents in areas that have huge oil deposits to resist a plan by the National Land Commission (NLC) to acquire 15,600 acres of oil fields in the area. Led by Governor Josphat Nanok, they said the land, which has been gazetted, will see 516 people displaced. Speaking at Uhuru Girls High School in Lokichar town on Saturday, they said the county government was not consulted before the decision was made. Nanok said the Council of Governors has filed a case in court over community land and therefore, there were no legal grounds to back the NLC’s February 15 gazette notice to acquire land on behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum. “Governors moved  to court in relation to the Community Lands Act where we protested that we could not allow the management of community land to be transferred to Ministry of Land instead of county government and the court is yet to decide. The law is what NLC should bank on,” he said adding that leaders would wish to lease the land as mining of oil would only take less than 30 years. Second option Others who addressed the meeting include deputy governor Peter Lotethiro, Senator Malachy Ekal, MPs James Lomenen (Turkana South),  Mohammed Ali Lokiru (Turkana East) and Jeremiah Lomorukai (Loima) and several MCAs. Senator Ekal and the MPs said that they would also be seeking a second option where they would petition for suspension of the NLC Gazette notice through the National Assembly. – KNA
