Speaking at the event convened by AMPlus International Ltd, the global payment solutions provider head of business development, Ankit Grover (pictured) expressed optimism at partnering with key business executives in the region, saying that having strong partnerships is an important component of the company’s service offering. For more than 10 years, Trans-fast has been helping those living in the diaspora send money back home conveniently, securely and cost-effectively, through the online platform, mobile application or depositing directly into recipient’s bank accounts. The global cross-border payments network provider covers more than 125 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, America and Australia. “Having strong partnerships in the region is a key component of Transfast’s service and Transfast has built its network strength in Africa by partnering with numerous banks and other institutions,” said Grover. He further said Africa receives a significant amount of international remittances annually and these are an important resource to local economies and families. According to Central Bank of Kenya statistics, the shilling’s stable performance against major international currencies has been partly supported by diaspora remittances.
