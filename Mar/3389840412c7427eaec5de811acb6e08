Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Investigations into the fatal shooting of lawyer Assa Nyakundi’s son took another twist after a post-mortem revealed the bullet was shot from a standing position. According to pathologists, the young Joseph Nyakundi may have been shot at after a confrontation. The bullet entered from the mid-chest and travelled downwards the eighth rib where it ricocheted and exited about 7.5cm near the left shoulder. As a result, Joseph Nyakundi bled a lot and his left lung collapsed. Lawyer Nyakundi had reported he was driving from church last Sunday with the son, when he accidentally shot him in the chest as he was trying to holster the gun. The three-hour autopsy was conducted on Wednesday at the Montezuma Funeral Home by Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor. He concluded the cause of death was “chest injuries and haemorrhage due to gunshot from a low velocity firearm”. The team The pathologist concluded that the person who shot the deceased could have been standing outside the rear back door of the vehicle the victim was in. Dr Oduor was accompanied by detectives from homicide department, ballistic experts, and forensic analysts. The family was represented by lawyer Cliff Ombeta, who yesterday told People Daily they were waiting for the final report, adding that it was still too early to establish whether it was accidental discharge or intentional.
