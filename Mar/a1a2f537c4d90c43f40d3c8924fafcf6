Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Controversial televangelist James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre spent his second day in police custody after he was arrested for threatening Citizen TV journalist Linus Kaikai. He was arrested on Sunday night from his church at the junction of Haile Selassie Avenue and Uhuru Highway and taken to Muthaiga Police Station. He was arrested after Kaikai reported to police his life was threatened after the pastor released a video footage attacking him. Ng’ang’a released the video after Kaikai said there was need to regulate the Church and save Kenyans from “spiritual fraudsters”. Kaikai was a panellist in one of the news show, News Gang. Last week, the pastor, dressed in military-like fatigue and calling himself a “Chief General Commander”, threatened Kaikai with unexplained “consequences”. “I am telling you, you have to stop that, if you don’t stop you will face the consequences,” he warned. In the programme, Kaikai had said: “We are dealing with thieves not men of God. These are cold blooded evangelical vampires living on the blood of their flock.”
