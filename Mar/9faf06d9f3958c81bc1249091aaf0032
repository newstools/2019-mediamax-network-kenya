Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Fresh details in the ongoing property saga between self-styled prophet David Owuor and the family of lawyer Jane Muthoni show  the latter helped the preacher establish his Holiness and Repentance Church. Close associates of Muthoni who spoke to People Daily yesterday said the relationship between Owuor and Muthoni goes back to the early 2000s. According to them, Owuor used to visit Muthoni’s law firm JM Njagi & Co Advocates where Muthoni would help him with money to buy food transport costs. “He used to visit our offices. We used to buy him food and pay for his transport,” a close associate who worked with Muthoni for almost 17 years told People Daily. As a result of the friendship, Muthoni help Owuor register his church  according to the source. “Our law firm helped Owuor to have the church, which very few people knew about at that time, registered,” said the associate. Muthoni, who had been an Anglican Church of Kenya faithful,   later joined the church.
