George Kebaso @Morarak An environmental watchdog body has called on the Ministry of Agriculture and county governments to prioritise the sector by supporting agricultural investments at the community level to avert deaths from hunger in  parts of the country. In a statement yesterday, Greenpeace Africa said it is an irony that people should die of starvation, in a country that has potential of being food sufficient. Food chain Food For Life campaigner Claire Nasike urged authorities to address food chain inadequacies to ensure food security in Kenya. “They should also ensure that farmers are paid on time to enable them supply produce to the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) frequently. “It is even more atrocious that the government is still in denial, claiming that the situation is under control when deaths are being recorded. Even more disturbing is the fact that, while many are at risk of starvation, stores in nearby counties are overflowing with food,” she said. A 2017 report indicates that about Sh150 billion worth of food went to waste or was left to rot as a result of poor post-harvest handling. “Cases of drought occur every three to four years, the government can certainly plan ahead,” she said. Turkana and Baringo county have in the past experienced heavy rainfall that resulted in flash floods.
