Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia on Thursday urged the government to ensure families of Kenyans, who perished in the ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines crash, are duly compensated. The Governor, who spoke at Kiandege village in Ndaragwa area during a mass to celebrate the life of a victims Ben Gathu, called on the National government to pursue the matter and ensure the bereaved families are compensated. He said compensation would go a long way in healing the wounds of loss and supporting the families left behind, adding that the county lost two individuals in the accident. “We have seen victims of crashes paid but the money never gets to them. The government should make follow ups and ensure the money, once paid, doesn’t not end up in wrong people’s pockets,” he said. Francis Mureithi, the spokesperson of the bereaved family said: “Our family and the church agreed to hold a service and not a burial because we were not sure if the soil had his remains.” He urged the government to ensure families of the deceased receive any tangible DNA results that will be retrieved. Gathu was travelling from Dubai when the crash occurred.
