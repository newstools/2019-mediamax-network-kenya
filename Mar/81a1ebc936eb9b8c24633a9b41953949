Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka The taxpayer risks losing more than Sh400 million in stalled housing scheme in Samburu, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, Auditor-General Edward Ouko has warned. In a report tabled in Parliament yesterday, construction of county government office block for Samburu Executives has stalled and the contractor left the site. Ouko said M/s Ole Noor General Hardware Limited was awarded a Sh 285,427,726 contract for the job in 2014. “Payments totaling to sh 256,799,646 and representing 96% of the contract sum had been made to the contract as of October 2018,” the report partly reads. Physical verification In Elgeyo Marakwet County, the auditor said completion of the governors’ residence had fallen behind schedule in spite of the county government paying Sh13,873,301.50 to an unnamed company. “A physical verification of the project on November 2018 revealed that the site remained deserted,” the report read. In Nandi county, former governor Cleophas Langat entered into a Sh103,383,420 contract with a company on December 2013, to construct the governor’s office but construction works had been abandoned at the time of audit. Further, the county cannot account for an excess of Sh8 million of irregular payments made to the Council of Governors (CoG), Delta Towers building that houses their liaison offices in Westlands, Nairobi.
