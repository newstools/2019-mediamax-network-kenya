Kenya Power will support the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by ensuring reliable power supply for them to prosper and contribute to the national economy. The utility firm said it will align SMEs to appropriate tariff bands to ensure they enjoy the benefits associated with the various tariff bands. “The government has identified SMEs as one of the major enablers in enhancing local manufacturing. Our role is to support these customers by providing quality and reliable energy to enable realisation of the country’s development goals,” Kenya Power acting General Manager Customer Service and Regional Co-ordination Aggrey Machasio. SMEs contribution in the manufacturing sector is expected to grow from the current 11.8 per cent to 20 per cent by the year 2022. Kenya Power is keen on leveraging  this growth to boost revenue from sale of electricity while at the same time positively contributing to the growth of the economy. The company has recorded a steady increment in revenue from SME customers over the years. In the financial year ended June 30, 2018, SMEs accounted for Sh27 billion in revenue from consumption of electricity compared to Sh23.9 billion recorded five years prior to this period. Towards enhancing the quality of supply, Kenya Power has been implementing the Boresha Umeme campaign in all SMEs Zones across the country. The campaign involves upgrading of existing network and ensuring the national street lighting project is functional to support the 24-hour economy.
