Energy Cabinet secretary Charles Keter has urged police to expedite investigations into the murder of an elderly woman by a gang of four men a week ago at Samoget village, Litein. Speaking during a funddrive for the burial of Anna Chepkwony, 73, the CS asked police to ensure the killers are brought to justice as fast as possible. “We have witnessed upsurge in criminal activities in Litein town and the surrounding areas of late where lives have been lost and it is high time we demand answers from security agents here,” he said. The gang invaded the home of Richard Chepkwony on February 20 armed with crude weapons and injured him, the housegirl and three granddaughters before reportedly slashing his wife on the neck. Police have since arrested two suspects and said they are assisting them with investigations. “We will catch all those involved in the attack soon,” Kericho Police Commander James Mugera said.
