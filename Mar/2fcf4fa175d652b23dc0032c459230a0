Musa Radoli @PeopleDailyKe After waiting for more than 60 frustrating years, a more than Sh5 billion sugar factory has roared into life in Busia County with a daily production capacity of more than 3,000 tonnes of sugarcane crushed per day. The Busia Sugar Industries (BSI) factory roared into life last week after a long protracted legal battles that forced President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto to intervene. Construction of the multi-billion-shilling factory, located at Busibwabo market in Matayos Sub-county of Busia County, was nearly brought to its knees because of the protracted legal battles seeking to stop its construction. The battles ironically according to the immediate former chairman of the Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association (Kesga) chairman Ibrahim Juma were engineered by a competitor who was trying to get a foothold in the sugar business in the county. Historic milestone Juma said: “This is a historic milestone for the county because apart from waiting for more than sixty years for any kind of factory in this county, we have also weathered one of the most dangerous and deadly phenomenon in the sub-sector – sugarcane poaching.” Late last year, while on a projects development tour in Busia, Ruto ordered Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to immediately issue BSI a licence to start processing sugar. “It also took the government’s forceful intervention with the competitor to withdraw the cases he had filed to derail construction of this factory.” The first attempt to construct a sugar factory was in the 1990s after the government bought more than 100 acres at Nasewa in Nambale sub-county in Busia County, but it became a cropper following sugar industry politics. Defunct BSI, with shadowy directors, was established to oversee sugarcane development programmes in the county as well as construction of a factory at Nasewa, complete with the factory’s nucleus sugarcane estate but it collapsed with a more than Sh100 million debt. It has since emerged that Booker Tate Plc, which was then managing Mumias Sugar Company, was opposed to the construction of the factory and reneged on releasing Mill “B” from Mumias to start up the Busia factory after taking over the ultra-modern diffuser technology factory. Yesterday BSI managing director Ali Taib said: “It has been a very long difficult struggle for us to produce ‘white gold’ in this county after so many endless protracted legal battles.” Taib said the company’s greatest effort now was to consolidate its collaboration with sugarcane farmers that it has contracted to ensure that there is a steady supply of the raw material for continuous production. Timely payment “We are also going to ensure that our farmers are paid their dues within a week after their sugarcane is delivered to our factory for processing. At the moment we have started with a 3,000 TCD processing per day, but with time we plan to increase it to more than 5,000 TCD,” he said. The company’s contracted sugarcane farmers had also been targeted in the poaching crisis that is still strangling the western Kenya sugar producing belt. BSI operations manager Ishmael Hussein Yusuf said the company was going to invest heavily in sugarcane development programmes, not only in Busia but other neighbouring counties like Siaya where there are viable farmers to contract. “We are acutely aware of the fact that with the demise of the Sugar Development Levy, sugarcane development programmes in the country died and as investors in the industry, it is our duty to invest in the development of sugarcane production,” said Hussein.
