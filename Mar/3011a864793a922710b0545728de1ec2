The Parliamentary Committee on Appointments has approved the nomination of George Magoha (pictured) as Education Cabinet secretary. Leader of Minority John Mbadi tabled the report, which will now be debated by members  to either approve or reject it. The committee found Prof Magoha suitable to hold the Education docket  having met all the requirements as stipulated in law. “The onus is on you members to either approve or reject the nomination,” Speaker Justin Muturi, who chairs the  team said. The committee  said Magoha meets the integrity standards having not been involved in any form of crime during his tenure in public life. When he appeared before the 28-member committee last week, Magoha said he was best placed to steer the Education ministry owing to his vast experience. If approved, Magoha will succeed Amina Mohammed, who was moved to the Sports docket after the then holder Rashid Echesa was sacked by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month.
