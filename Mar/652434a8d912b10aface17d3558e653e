Kenya sevens rugby team has been boosted by the inclusion of fly-half Johnstone Olindi and Mean Machine forward Shadon Munoko for the sixth leg of the World Rugby Series in Vancouver, Canada this weekend. Visa complications had a week earlier locked out Olindi from travelling to Las Vegas, USA for the fifth round but the Kenya Rugby Union re-arranged his departure to Sunday while reserve player Munoko is set to make his debut as replacement for the injured Brian Wandera. Injured substitute Munoko joined the Shujaa set up last year and only featured for the Kenya Morans in the Safari Sevens tournament in November. He left for Canada on Monday as injured substitute Wandera returned to the country on Tuesday. Olindi meanwhile made his debut in the series opener in Dubai where he impressed. In his absence in Vegas last week, his top performing record of most points scored (64), most runs (57), tackles (30) and line breaks (10) was surpassed by Daniel Taabu and Vincent Onyala, making his inclusion a major boost. The two inclusions will be key for Shujaa in Vancouver where head coach Paul Murunga has a tough task of navigating past group opponents Fiji, Samoa and hosts Canada.
