Homeboyz women’s rugby team savoured a 15-5 win over Nakuru ladies to take command of the nine-team competition played at the RFUEA grounds on Sunday. Dorcas Mokaya stepped up her game to win it for Homeboyz with a hat-trick of tries with Nakuru’s unconverted try scored by Veronica Wanjiru in the second half. The deejays led the match 10-0 at the break making it tough for the visitors to make a comeback despite both sides scoring five points in the second period. Mokaya landed her hat-rick on resumption as Nakuru capitalised on an overlap after Homeboyz winger Irene Otieno was sinbined for infringement. Nakuru came in as favourites, having beaten the deejays 19-7 in group matches but a much-changed Homeboyz, boosted by the return of Kenyan international Sheila Chajira avenged the loss. Homeboyz skipper Chajira attributed the performance to the return of experienced players having fielded new players in the opening two legs at Impala and Kenyatta University. “This season we had a rotational plan whereby new players were introduced in the system and we struggled in the first two legs but we have linked up with them and we are on a course to better this performance in the remaining tournaments for the overall title,” said Chajira. Nakuru bagged silver while Impala (last year’s champions) settled for bronze after downing Northern Suburbs 10-0 in the 10-a-side five-leg KRU Women’s Festival. Impala were denied a second consecutive finals slot by Nakuru who beat them by just one try (5-0) in the first semi-final as Homeboyz scored two unconverted tries for a 10-0 win over Northern Suburbs in the other last four match. Mwamba settled for fifth place courtesy of a 12-0 win over Shamas Rugby Foundation while Kisumu Dolphins dispatched Comras 31-0 for seventh place.
