Health workers across the country are headed back to the streets to protest plans by Council of Governors (CoG) to employ them on contract. Through the Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) and Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu), they have vowed to paralyse the health sector, saying the proposal is illegal. Knun secretary general Seth Panyako said health workers across the country are ready to react if the proposal is endorsed. Cotu boss Francis Atwoli said workers are opposed to casualisation of labour. Speaking in Naivasha, Atwoli termed the proposal as laughable adding that it would not be implemented as it is against the Constitution.
