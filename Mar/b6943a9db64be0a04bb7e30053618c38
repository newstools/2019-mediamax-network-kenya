Uasin Gishu County MP Gladys Shollei has differed with her National Assembly and Senate colleagues from Rift Valley over their sustained attacks on President Uhuru Kenyatta. Addressing the press in Eldoret town, Shollei faulted her colleagues for “disrespecting the Office of the President through constant attacks directed at the Head of State”. She asked the leaders to accord the Presidency the respect it deserves regardless of their status in society. “Even if you don’t like the President whatever reasons, just accord that seat the respect it deserves because it is the symbol of unity of our country,” she said. Shollei was reacting to recent attacks on the President by some Rift Valley elected leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto. The politicians. led by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, have claimed the war against corruption was aimed at scuttling Ruto’s presidential ambition. The leaders, including Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and his Soy counterpart Caleb Kositany have dared Uhuru to declare he has fallen out with his deputy. They said they were ready to part ways with the President and Jubilee Party on grounds that Uhuru was using the new-found relations with ODM leader Raila Odinga to fight Ruto. “You cannot hide behind the Handshake and fight against corruption when we know that the agenda is to fight Ruto politically. Uhuru should come and tell us if he is tired of his deputy and we call it a day,” said Murkomen, who is also Senate Leader of Majority. The politicians further claimed that the war on graft was aimed at derailing the construction of multi-billion-shilling Arror and Kimwarer dam projects in Elgeyo Marakwet county. Their remarks come amid investigations into how Sh21 billion allocated to the two projects were used. Shollei told her colleagues to desist from making remarks that could trigger disunity and disharmony among Kenyans.
