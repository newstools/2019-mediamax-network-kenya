Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Looking fatigued but composed, Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich yesterday afternoon appeared before detectives for yet another session of questioning — the fourth — regarding the proposed Arror and Kamwarer dams in Elgeyo Marakwet county. This was after a multi-agency investigating team comprising the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Assets Recovery Authority and the National Intelligence Service summoned him again to clarify some issues on his statement. Yesterday was the third consecutive day for the CS to record statements. He was first questioned a fortnight ago.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, he spent more than 12 hours each day at the DCI headquarters. Rotich arrived at the DCI headquarters yesterday at around 4pm where his lawyer Katwa Kigen was waiting for him. “We called him to clarify a few things. This is part of the investigations,” a senior officer said. The CS is required to shed light on the controversial Sh20 billion paid that CMC di Ravenna as advance payement for the construction of the two dams. The DCI is also expected to grill Water Cabinet secretary Simon Chelugui over the stalled construction of Itare multipurpose dam in Nakuru county. The Sh28 billion tender was also awarded to CMC di Ravenna, which has applied for insolvency in Italy. Just like in the case of Arror and Kimwarer dams, it means it is incapacitated to enter into or complete existing obligations and enjoys cover from creditors.
