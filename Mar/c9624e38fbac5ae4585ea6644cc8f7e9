Munira Mandano, Murimi Mutiga and David Shariff Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has welcomed ODM’s decision not to expel him. He was facing expulsion together with her Malindi counterpart Aisha Jumwa but survived the ouster after the party National Governing Council (NGC) deferred its decision. His retention was informed by an apology he presented to the party secretary general Edwin Sifuna. Disciplinary action NGC resorted to adopt the party’s disciplinary committee resolutions to have Jumwa expelled from ODM for violating the party rules. However, Jumwa has cried foul following her expulsion and threatened to take court action today. She wants the court to quash the decision claiming the party flouted the law to ensure she was kicked out, that there was corruption and double standards.  Jumwa rubbished claims of a looming by-election  saying she will finish her five years term as per the law. And speaking yesterday at Dori Girls Secondary School during the official handing over of the laboratory equipment worth Sh200,000, Dori reiterated that his allegiance to the party still remains intact. “I would like to appreciate the ODM party leader Raila Odinga and NGC for listening to my plea as well as believing and standing with me for the benefit of Msambweni residents. I assure you that I’m still a strong and loyal member of ODM party,” said the legislation who was addressing the residents of Gazi area in Kwale county. Own cross He said his intention is to work together with diverse leaders for the welfare of his people. Elsewhere, some leaders in Kilifi county have told Jumwa to fight her own battles. Ganze MP Teddy Mwabire and his Kilifi South counterpart Ken Chonga said Jumwa must carry her own cross for failing to follow the stipulated party policies and even going as far as abusing party officials.
