Seth Onyango @SethManex With nothing to bury, families of Kenyans who perished in the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash have appealed to the government to erect a monument in honour of their kin. This comes even as some of the affected families started holding funerals as they seek closure over the loss of their loved ones. At a meeting with government officials yesterday, the bereaved families said it was now  apparent they will not have the remains of their loved ones. “I know the process is going to be long and we would like the government to help us build a monument so that we can remember them,”  said Benson Birundu, who lost his daughter in the crash. Meanwhile, it is emerging that Yared Getachew, the captain of the doomed airplane had not practised on a new simulator for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 before taking the flight. His colleagues told Reuters that he was due for refresher training at the end of March. The Ethiopian crash followed another MAX 8 crash in Indonesia in October and has set off one of the biggest inquiries in aviation history, focused on whether pilots were sufficiently versed on a new automated system. Suitable location In both cases, the pilots lost control soon after take-off and fought a losing battle to stop their jets plunging down. In Nairobi, families have asked the government to help them get lawyers that will represent them in compensation claims. For international flights, a global air carrier treaty dubbed the Montreal Convention was put in place in 1999 that provides guidelines that compensates those who perished in plane crash. Yesterday, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau sought to reassure the bereaved families that the government would provide all the necessary support during the difficult times. It includes providing land in a suitable location where the memorial monument will be built and avail any legal aid that the families desire in consultation with the Attorney General.
