Grace Angela @PeopleDailyKe The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has made an emergency drought appeal following the aggravated food shortage in Turkana. Reports from humanitarian agencies, local media and assessments done by the Catholic Church indicate that, the affected population has reached 1,111,500 people in the month of March this year. Donate funds According to the findings, the 12 worst hit counties are Turkana, Baringo, Mandera, Garissa, Kilifi, Tana River, West Pokot, Marsabit, Makueni, Kajiado, Kwale and Isiolo leaving a total of 865,300 people in dire need of food donation. The temperatures are said to be above average becoming a major cause of rapid drying of dams, water pans and other water sources. “We appreciate efforts made by the National and county governments to remedy the situation. We call upon the government and other humanitarian agencies to continue with the work they are doing,” said Philip Anyolo, Chairman of Kenya Conference of Bishops. Further, the Catholic Church urged Kenyans to donate funds, food and non-food items to save the lives of those affected. Nairobi governor Mike Sonko, who is also the Good Deeds Ambassador, has donated relief food and other non- food items to the hungry-stricken in  Turkana.
