Algiers, Monday Algerians on Monday dismissed President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s promise to quit early if re-elected for a fifth time and said they were ready for new protests seeking his resignation. The ailing leader, who suffered a stroke in 2013, vowed in a letter read out on state television late Sunday to organise a “national conference” that would set a date for further polls which he would not contest. Hearts protesters “I pledge not to be a candidate in that election which will ensure I am succeeded in undeniable conditions of serenity, freedom and transparency,” the letter read. “I listened and heard the cry from the hearts of protesters and in particular the thousands of young people who questioned me about the future of our homeland,” it said. His message — followed by the formal submission of his candidacy for the April 18 poll by his campaign manager Abdelghani Zaalane — failed to win hearts as new protests hit the capital Algiers and other cities. In central Algiers hundreds of mostly young demonstrators rallied peacefully overnight Sunday and into the early hours of Monday as a helicopter buzzed overhead and police deployed gradually across the city. Similar protests were reported in other cities across the North African country overnight. As the week unfolded Monday, residents of the capital told AFP they were already planning for more protests as they dismissed Bouteflika’s promises as an “insult”. Bouteflika “thinks we’re idiots. We said n o (to him). And ‘we’ are a people 42-million strong,” said Karim, a 22-year-old unemployed man who declined to give his surname. Take part Mohammed, a 69-year-old retired man, insisted he was ready to take part in his “first ever” demonstration next Friday. Local newspapers also expressed their fury, with Al-Watan daily saying Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term showed “contempt” for the tens of thousands of Algerians who have taken to the streets since February 22 calling for him to resign. — AFP
