A confident national Under-23 football team Emerging Stars Team jetted out to Khartoum, Sudan, at the weekend ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations-cum-Olympics qualifying first leg match against the hosts tomorrow. The junior team, which is under the tutelage of Francis Kimanzi, will be seeking a favourable result in the sweltering conditions of Khartoum to make the return leg in Nairobi on March 26 in Kasarani a mere formality. Speaking before the team’s departure, a bullish Kimanzi said the boys will draw great inspiration from the convincing win over Mauritius to prevail over their opponents. “We did well against Mauritius and it’s good that we have retained a big part of that squad. The boys are motivated and I am confident we will get a positive result. Obviously, we expect a tough match but I have this belief that Kenya will give a good account of themselves,” said Kimanzi. Nigeria or Libya next This match comes after Kenya made light work of Mauritius in the first round, consequently booking the Baby Nile Crocodiles of Sudan in the second. The winner on aggregate will face either Nigeria or Libya in the third round to determine who graces the 2019 Africa U23 Cup of Nations in Egypt, which will act as a qualifier to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan.
