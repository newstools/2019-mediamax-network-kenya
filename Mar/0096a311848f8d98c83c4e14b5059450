Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Judiciary is on the spot over Sh876.8 million that was illegally transferred to 21 tribunals in the country. Auditor General Edward Ouko raised queries that there was no actual transfer to the entities but the funds were utilised by the Judiciary. According to Ouko, despite the expenditure, the Judiciary failed to provide all the details for each of the tribunals to him for the audit. “In the circumstances, the propriety and validity of Sh876, 890,288 expenditure on the 21 tribunals could not be ascertained as a proper charge on public funds,” the reports says in part. Pending bills Consequently, Ouko has raised concerns over the 613.7 million pending bills that was not settled but instead carried forward to the 2018/19 financial year. Ouko regretted that the pending bills were not supported with contracts, invoices, works completion certificates and payment vouchers. He observed that had the bills been cleared and charged to the vote, the statements and receipts for the year 2017/18 would have reflected a net deficit of Sh517.3 million instead of the net surplus Sh96.4 million. “In addition, no explanation was provided for failure to pay the pending bills as they fell due. In view of the foregoing, the propriety and validity of the pending bills of Sh613.7 million could not be confirmed,” he said. In the audit report tabled in the National Assembly, Ouko also raised concerns over the construction of 39 law courts across the country worth Sh3 billion that is funded by the government. Despite the award of the contracts for the construction of the courts in 2013, he said they have not been completed to date. According to an analysis of the projects status provided by the judiciary the construction works valued at Sh1.5 billion had been certified  for payment, however, details of certificates issued  and total amount paid for each project were not made  available  for audit review.
