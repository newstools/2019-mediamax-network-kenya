Football is all about scoring goals. Mainly though, the job of goalscoring is left to the midfielders and the strikers. What every manager loves is seeing a goal-laden partnership developing in his side and here are some that stood out. 1.  Di Stefano &  Puskas  (Real Madrid 1958-64) (Combined Appearances 433, Goals 360) Before the days of Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid was home to the finest partnership of all, with Alfredo Di Stefano and the great Hungarian Ferenc Puskas lighting up the 1950s and 1960s. Real Madrid won five consecutive European cups between 1956 and 1960 with Di Stefano scoring an astonishing 165 goals over these five seasons. Puskas joined in 1958, ensuring the goal flow at the Santiago Bernabeu reached epic proportions. His time in Spain yielded 156 goals from 180 La Liga appearances, and 35 goals from 39 European Cup appearances while Di Stefano ended his Real career with 307 goals in 396 appearances. 2. Butragueno & Sanchez (Real Madrid 1985-92) (Combined Appearances 597, Goals 331) This particular pre-Galactico period in Real Madrid’s history was actually one of their most dominant domestic spells, as a fifth consecutive La Liga title was sealed in 1990. A big part of this was the double threat of Emilio Butragueno and Hugo Sanchez. Unlike many prolific forward lines, they did not get on at all, but they at least had a healthy mutual professional respect. One astonishing point to note from the 1989-90 season is not the fact that Sanchez scored 38 goals from 35 games, but that all of these goals were scored with only one touch. 3. Rush & Dalglish (Liverpool 1980-87) (Combined Appearances 665, Goals 300) Liverpool fans of a certain age will hold wonderful memories of the 1980s and the legendary strike-pairing of Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish. From the 1981-82 season onwards began a partnership of the sort that Kop regulars had almost grown used to, as memories were still fresh of the Toshack/Keegan days. This 1981-82 season saw the emergence of the Welsh forward Rush, who scored 30 goals in 49 appearances, including 17 in the league. 4. Henry & Bergkamp (Arsenal 1999-2006) (Combined Appearances 610, Goals 266) The union of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp was one that married two perfectly fitting styles of play. Henry brought the poacher’s instinct, fearsome skill, and pace, while Bergkamp at times languidly conducted Arsenal’s attacking orchestra. The partnership yielded Arsene Wenger’s most successful period as Arsenal manager, culminating in an unbeaten season in May 2004. Henry may have scored 214 of those goals, being the standout marksman from this pairing, but as most will know, Bergkamp was about much more than just goals. 5 . Mancini & Vialli (Sampdoria 1984-92) (Combined Appearances 554, Goals 231) Italian football is famed for its tight defences, not its goal machine strikers, but Gialuca Vialli, in the 1988-89 season, managed a stunning 33 goals in all competitions. He was the more prolific of the two Italians, but Roberto Mancini had the greater longevity at Sampdoria, spending a nearly career-spanning 15 years at the club. Their partnership brought one Serie A title, three Coppa Italias, one Italian Super Cup, and a European Cup Winners Cup to Sampdoria. 6. Keegan & Toshack (Liverpool 1971-77) (Combined Appearances 532, Goals 189) Liverpool’s glory days of the 1970s owe much to the wonderful big man/little man combination of Kevin Keegan and John Toshack. For six years, the duo tormented defences around England and eventually Europe, with two UEFA Cups and one European Cup ending up in the Anfield trophy room. Their credentials were confirmed in 1973, when the pairing led Liverpool to a league and UEFA Cup double. Two more titles were to follow, in 1976 and 1977, but the crowning achievement was to come in that 1976-77 campaign where they won league and European Cup double. Over the five seasons they were together, Keegan got 102 goals and Toshack scored 96. 7. Cole & Yorke (Man United 1998-2002) (Combined appearances 285, Goals 129) Manchester United have set many records over the years, but one of the stand-out achievements has to be the treble-winning campaign of 1998-99. The trio of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League is a one-off in English football history, and a cornerstone of that unprecedented success was the striking partnership between Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke. The understanding they shared led to 53 goals between them in all competitions, including key strikes against Barcelona and Juventus on their way to glory. The duo plundered another 45 the year after as United reclaimed their domestic title. 8. Shearer & Sutton (Blackburn 1994-96) (Combined Appearances 167, Goals 96) When Kenny  Dalglish brought Alan Shearer to Ewood Park from Southampton, he knew he was getting something special -a ruthless goal machine. That proved to be sound judgement as Shearer hit 56 goals in 74 games for Blackburn, as they cemented their place back in the top division. When Chris Sutton was recruited from Norwich City before the 1994-95 season, the puzzle was completed. By the end of that season, Blackburn had won the Premier League title, their first league title since 1914, Shearer scoring 34 league goals that season, with his sidekick Sutton contributing 15. 9 . Zamorano & Salas (Chile 1994-2001) (Combined Appearances 103, Goals 59) The France ‘98 World Cup was an opportunity for the squad to make up for lost time, as the Chile national side had been banned from USA 1994 for attempting to get an Italia ‘90 qualifier abandoned, also being disqualified from that tournament. Warming up for France ‘98, Salas gave an individual display of excellence at Wembley as Chile beat England 2-0. Salas and Zamorano had already ripped up the qualifying phase, sharing an incredible 23 goals to ensure they qualified ahead of Peru on goal difference. At the tournament, Salas scored thrice to seal a last 16 match against Brazil and while they were eliminated, it didn’t matter as the duo had already written itself into Chilean folklore. 10. Beardsley & Lineker (England 1986-92) (Combined Appearances 119, Goals 50) Arguably England’s greatest ever international pairing came together in 1986, not long after another England frontman, John Barnes, had scored his wonder goal in Brazil. Long-term, he was about to be overshadowed by the class of Gary Lineker and Peter Beardsley. The little creative genius Beardsley was perfect for the poaching qualities of Lineker to profit from, and this pairing helped England to a creditable showing in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, before nearly taking them all the way at Italia 90.
