Alvin Mwangi and KNA @PeopleDailyKe Public Service Vehicle owners yesterday protested a proposal by the government to regulate fares, arguing that  the State should first work on saving the sector from incurring  more losses. Matatu Owners Association (MOA) chairman Simon Kimutai urged Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia to consult stakeholders to consult on way forward in accordance with the law. “If the government starts to regulate as it is saying, our passengers will be left to suffer. Let there be fairness and involvement while doing all these,” added Kimutai. His sentiments come after it emerged that Macharia has drafted a proposal to amend the Traffic Act and the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) act to control fares across the country to protect public from exploitation. On Tuesday, Transport CAS Chris Obure presented the proposal before Parliament seeking to introduce changes in both NTSA and Traffic Acts. PSV operators in Kwale echoed Kimutai’s sentiments views on grounds  that the move will ruin their business.
