Amos Abuga @PeopleSport11 The State Department for Correctional services has recalled the Kenyan Women’s volleyball defending champions Prisons for breach of protocol and contravention of rules regarding public servants travel overseas. In a later signed by Principal Secretary in State Department for Correctional Services Zeinab Hussein, the ministry yesterday organised the repatriation of the team that was taking part in the 2019 women’s club championships in Cairo, Egypt. The department has distanced itself from either clearing or financing the team to take part in the annual event. The PS statement termed the media reports that the team was in distress in Cairo as embarrassing to the country. “Whilst the government acknowledges and supports sports as one of the many sources of our national pride, we regret the turn of events, which have caused the people of Kenya undue embarrassment,” read part of the statement. National pride The timing of the statement is suspicious,  coming after the wardresses were bundled out of the championships following a 3-1 (25-15, 25-20, 22-25 and 25-21) defeat to Egyptian side El Shams, results that made them fail to progress past the group stage on Wednesday. On Tuesday Josp Barasa’s side lost 3-1 to Algeria side GSP, amatch that was preceded by the team’s inability  to pay the tournament’s subscription fee a matter that had threatened to have them suspended from the continental body. The five-time Africa champions arrived in Cairo late Saturday after the first matches of the championships had been played.
