Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has denied reports attributed to the Auditor General that his administration did not account for Sh11.2 billion in the 2017/18 financial year, terming it “untrue and unfair”. In a media statement yesterday, Kinyanjui said the county’s budget for the year was Sh12.5 billion, including Sh5.5 billion for salaries. “Does it mean we went a whole year without paying salaries?” he asked. Fight against graft “The allegations of loss of funds are wrong and misleading. The county government of Nakuru is committed to prudent use of funds to ensure service delivery to residents,” he said. The report was carried in the People Daily. On the construction of double unit market stalls in Molo, he said the county paid Sh3.8 million as indicated by the report. Meanwhile, Kinyanjui has vowed to crack the whip on corrupt county officers, saying he will not tolerate theft of public funds. “We must fight graft on all levels because it is costing us a lot as a country,” he said. “A country where corruption is an industry, poverty is also an industry but a time will come when each of us must say I have a role to play in anti-graft war and, I think, the time has come,” Kinyanjui added.
