Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA) is concerned over potential increase of marine pollution risks in the wake of offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration in the Indian Ocean. Development of Lokichar to Lamu oil pipeline which will have a storage facility at the new Lamu port in Kililana, Lamu West have also triggered concerns among players in the coast region. They say although these projects are significant, sufficient safety  efforts should be  in place for the sake of marine safety. Environmentalists say the multi-billion-shilling mega projects call for heightened attention on the part of the government owing to probable oil spills that could cause extensive havoc. The agency said it has therefore rolled out oil spill response management trainings and awareness campaign on marine safety as it seeks to stave off any potential calamity. KMA Director general Maj (Rtd) George Okong’o said the training is in line with International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, 1990 which provides a framework for responding and co-operation during oil spills. “There has been increased activities both offshore and onshore in search of oil and gas with discoveries already made onshore. These discoveries increase the risks of pollution incidents on our waters,” he said. The training drew participants from the Norwegian, Coastal Administrative representatives, ministries, Non-Governmental Organisations, Oil companies and representatives from the private sector.
