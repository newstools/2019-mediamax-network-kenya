National Secondary Schools basketball boys runners-up Sigalame High School from  Busia County  will face  Nairobi champions  Dagoretti High in Pool B of  KSSSA  Term Games  set for next month in Mombasa. Other teams in the group include Agoro Sare from Nyanza who will be making their maiden participation at the national level   and Eastern representative whose winner is yet to be known. Sigalame returned to the national scene for the second year running after beating Friends School Kamusinga in the finals at Kaimosi Girls’ High School grounds. Sigalame coach Joseph Were said they like a challenging pool but “we must play semis and we must play finals.” “The new rule of fielding only three foreign players will favour us in the finals and especially against Laiser Hill who had over five foreigners when we met them in the finals last year,” he said. Were said they are not worried meeting Dagoretti at the group stages; we met them at the same stage last year and we hammered them thoroughly, adding that they have a weaker team that will take them far. Nyanza teams have sounded a warning to their rivals ahead of the national secondary schools term one games. The Nyanza region term one games concluded at Homa Bay School with Kanyawanga (handball boys), Sega (handball girls), Barchando (basketball girls) retaining their titles. New champions emerged in rugby 7s (Agoro Sare), 15s rugby (Maseno School) girl’s hockey (Nyamira Girls), boy’s hockey (Homa Bay School) and Agoro Sare (basketball).
