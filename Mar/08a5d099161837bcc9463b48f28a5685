AMOS ABUGA Former Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier league champion Kenya Police hope for a perfect start to the 2019 season when they play Nairobi Simba (Sikh Union) Sunday at the City Park Stadium. That will be the only men’s topflight league match set for Week Two of the new campaign that got underway on March 2. Record women’s champion Telkom; get their title defence underway when they handed Amira Sailors a welcoming sour lesson to the women’s premier league for the first time in 16 years with head coach Jos Openda. Glittering stint With the champions not in action last week, Strathmore University’s Scorpions sent warning signals with and emphatic 9-0 win over Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) last Sunday. It will be of interest to see how Telkom get their season underway especially without Openda who called it quits at the end of last season after a glittering stint with the side. Under Openda’s stratagem, that lasted a over 16 years, saw him lift the women’s premier league title 16 times, and also Eight Africa Club Championships accolades. An interesting aspect is that Telkom, the record Kenyan winners are unbeaten in the last six season on the trot. Experienced forward, Jackline Mwangi, is not in question the quartet of Rose Mbulo, Judy Apioh, Jackline  Atieno and Josephine  Ataro are up to task to fill the huge boots.
