Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka State officers under investigation or prosecution in any corruption-related case will have to step aside until their cases are heard and determined if a proposed amendment tabled in Parliament is debated, approved and enacted into law. The proposal by various agencies on corruption and economic crimes seeks to nail governors and constitutional office holders, who have sought refuge in law and refused to step aside to allow investigations into their conduct. Appearing before Senate Justice, Legal and Human Rights committee  led by Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei, the agencies under the chairmanship of Attorney General Kihara Kariuki said State officers charged with corruption still occupy  their offices, despite “the inherent and obvious risk of compromising case investigations and evidence”. “This portends challenges in terms of tampering with evidence and witnesses, and interference with investigations and prosecution,” Kariuki said. “We appeal that this committee supports the proposed review of legislation that will enhance the government’s anti-corruption war and recovery of proceeds of crime,” they submitted.
