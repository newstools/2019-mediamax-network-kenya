Seth Onyango @SethManex Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) says the way out of cyclical electoral dispute is to hold national and county elections on separate dates. Chairman Wafula Chebukati argued that staggering of the elections for national and county positions will enhance efficiency and reduce pressure on the poll systems and personnel. Chebukati was upbeat this would ease pressure on the commission and thus improve the credibility of the poll outcome. In his submissions to the Buildings Bridges Initiative (BBI) taskforce, he proposed a law on replacement of a deputy governor when the office falls vacant. Of concern is that Nairobi County has not had a deputy governor since the exit of Polycarp Igathe who resigned in January last year. According to sources, Governor Mike Sonko has been apprehensive about appointing a deputy, fearing that to do so would be opening an avenue for his ouster. Yesterday, Chebukati also recommended that the time frame for the hearing and determination of presidential election petition be extended from 14 days to 30 days. Stakeholders have always argued the time given for hearing and determining poll disputes was too limited given the voluminous documents that have to be perused during such petitions.
