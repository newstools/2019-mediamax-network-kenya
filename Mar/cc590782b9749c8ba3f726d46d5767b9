Confusion marred the first day of the sixth Devolution Conference in Kirinyaga after many delegates and journalists found their names missing from the list forwarded to the Council of Governors (CoG) for accreditation. Some delegates were unable to access the venue after their names went missing and were advised to liaise with the CoG secretariat. But even with the registration hitch, security was beefed up with law enforcement agents stationed along the nearby towns as thousands of delegates arrived in the county for the conference yesterday. Boom in business was reported in almost all fields especially the hospitality industry. Kirinyaga Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman John Kabui said most hotels were full, forcing some guests to seek accommodation outside the county. “By managing to host more than 6,000 guests, Kirinyaga has proved its worth as a county capable of holding other bigger conferences, including international conventions,” he added. Meanwhile, the county government has in the last two days distributed 150,000 condoms to hotels and guest houses. “This is nothing new, we are only concerned about our guests and that is why we are issuing the free condoms to almost all the hotels with accommodation space and guest houses,”  said Public Health deputy director Peter Irungu at the Kerugoya Level Four Hospital. He said there will be no room for hawking in the county during the four-day conference that is expected to be officially opened by President Kenyatta today at the Kirinyaga University grounds. “We have banned hawking in the county until the conference is over so that we do not have cases of communicable diseases,’’ he said.
