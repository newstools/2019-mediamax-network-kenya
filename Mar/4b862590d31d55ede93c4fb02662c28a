A row between Mombasa Governor  Hassan Joho and Members of the County Assembly has escalated, with the latter daring Joho to make good his threat to instigate their ouster. The MCAs vowed not to be intimidated, saying  they have a well stipulated oversight mandate which they would deliver on without fear. Their remarks came a day after Joho on Sunday threatened to mobilise residents to collect signatures to impeach some MCAs for allegedly fighting his leadership. He claimed the ward leaders are being used by his detractors to derail his agenda for the county. About 10 MCAs have threatened to impeach three members of County Executive over what they term “incompetence and derailed development”. The targeted CECs are Tawfiq Balala (Transport), Munyoki Kyalo (Youth and Sports) and Edward Nyale (Lands). The MCAs have also threatened to remove nominated MCA Mohamed Hatimy from the chairmanship of the Finance committee. Led by Kongowea MCA Mohammed Abrari, the ward reps said Joho had no power to remove them from office. “We are elected by citizens,” he said. He claimed Joho has failed to address pressing problems that residents are grappling with such as water shortage and uncollected garbage. “We cannot sit and watch MCAs being blamed by Joho yet it is his administration which has failed. I have taken seven complaints statements on the Karama garbage site, yet none of it has ever seen the light of the day, the Executive just sits on it,” said Abrari. He said the MCAs have started collecting signatures to remove the CECs from office. Old Town MCA Murfad Abdalla Amur asked Joho to allow the County Assembly performs its duties without interference. He said though the Joho is entitled to his opinion, he was misinformed on his claims that MCAs are fighting him. Meanwhile, Likoni MP Mishi Mboko defended Joho and  accused MCAs of planning to frustrate his leadership.
