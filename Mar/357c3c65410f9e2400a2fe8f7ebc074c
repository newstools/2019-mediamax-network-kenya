George Kebaso @Morarak National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has underscored the importance of research in fulfillment of MPs’ legislative roles, especially in providing solutions for social, economic and political challenges. He urged MPs to clearly define the issues they wish to focus on in Parliament and that they ensure the same are backed by evidence. “Institutionalisation of research services in parliaments and strengthening their capacity is the best way of addressing most of the challenges that undermine parliamentary effectiveness,” he said while opening the inaugural African Parliamentary Researchers’ Conference at a Nairobi hotel yesterday. “This would also include the evidence they need to successfully get parliament to closely address issues such as corruption,” he added. Speakers at the forum said Parliament cannot hold the Executive responsible for its shortcomings without having solid information to back its claims. Clerk of the Senate who doubles up Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) secretary Jeremiah Nyegenye said it is unfortunate that MPs are not able to pin down the Executive on the ills it commits because the research unit in Parliament lacks adequate resources. Transition countries “The Executive has more resources in terms of research as compared to Bunge and Judiciary combined. We used to enjoy the resources when ministers were part of Bunge but after their departure we are on our own,” he said. He added that since parliamentarians are charged with legislation and holding the Executive accountable to the public, the need for legislative information and research, especially in developing and transition countries is important. “Based on the governance structures whether parliamentary, presidential or hybrid which delineate the extent of separation of powers, parliaments should interface their policy processes with evidence generated by research units and policy institutions through coordinated partnerships,” he said.
