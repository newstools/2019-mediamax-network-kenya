Zaddock Angira and Nancy Gitonga @PeopleDailyKe Barclays Bank of Kenya will not take any new safe deposit boxes, and is working with its clients to review the existing ones, it has said. The move comes a day after Sh2 billion, in fake currency, and fake gold weighing about 70kg, were found at the bank’s strong room and four suspects arrested on Tuesday. The banks chief executive officer Jeremy Awori yesterday said though they had operated the safe deposit box service in line with local and global regulatory requirements, the bank had as an extra precaution taken a decision not to keep them anymore. “We recognise the emergence of new financial crime risks associated with the use of this service,” he said. Awori also assured the public that all currency dispensed over their counters and ATMs was genuine. The bank had earlier on Tuesday defended itself saying: “Barclays Bank in the usual course of business offers safe deposit boxes. The contents of personal safe deposit boxes are not part of the bank’s deposits and are only known to the client.” On Wednesday, a team led by the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti and Flying Squad boss Musa Yego camped at the bank for about three hours with the management and the Head of Security, George Maracha. Awori also said that their two employees — Boaz Ochich and Charles Manzi — who had been arrested on Tuesday for questioning had been released, and were cooperating with the investigators. Meanwhile, four suspects arrested in connection with fake cash will spend five more days in police custody. Former Rangwe  parliamentary aspirant Erick Adede, Ahmed Shah, Elizabeth Muthoni and Irene Wairimu will be held at Kileleshwa police station until March 26 to enable police complete investigations
