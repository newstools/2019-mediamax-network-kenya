The Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) has given this year’s national examination candidates until tomorrow to provide authentic birth certificates. The council opened up registration for keying and amending birth certificate numbers following concerns that some of the candidates registered did not provide genuine birth certificate numbers. She said failure to provide genuine certificates is an examination anomaly. In a circular to County and Sub-County Directors of Education, Acting chief executive  Mercy Karogo warned that at the lapse of this period, the data will be validated with Integrated Persons Registration Services (IPRS) department. This came as Education Ministry downplayed reports that Knec has cancelled registration of hundreds of thousands of candidates set to sit national exams this year. Kirinyaga County Education director Margaret Murigi said there was no cause for alarm, further explaining that lack of birth certificates or use of fake birth certificates cannot deny any candidate a chance to sit their national examination. Elsewhere, Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) Kisumu branch demanded that more time be given to fix arising anomalies. Kisumu East Knut executive secretary Joshua Ogola said yesterday there is time to remedy the situation and asked affected schools be given three months to address the problem.
