Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Members of the National Assembly yesterday told Prof George Magoha not to take what they termed as his dictatorial tendencies to the education docket on the day that they unanimously approved his nomination to be the next Education Cabinet secretary. While debating the report of the Appointments Committee, the MPs told Magoha to listen to all the stakeholders including the MPs whenever there are issues that they want addressed. According to the legislators it is only through consultations that he will be in a position to steer the ministry to greater heights. Led by Leader of Minority John Mbadi, MPs Chris Wamalwa(Kiminini), James Nyikal (Seme), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Otiende Amollo (Rarieda) and Mille Odhiambo (Suba North) described Magoha as the best suited person to head the docket. “I have no doubt that he is going to work with other players such as Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers (Kuppet) and Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) for the success of new curriculum,” said Wamalwa. Nyikal said that while his firm stance may sometimes be seen as arrogance, he is a very understanding as he accepts his mistakes when he is on the wrong.
