Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Members of the National Assembly have suspended the construction of 24 dams worth Sh188.2 billion until unresolved issues surrounding the projects have been sorted out. The MPs claimed that the contractors have turned the projects into a cash cow where they demand kickbacks before embarking on work. The suspended dam projects include Kamumu (Sh6 billion), Rupingazi (Sh5.5 billion) and Thambana (Sh5 billion) in Embu county, Kithino and Thingithu dams (Sh600 million) in Meru county and Maara dam (Sh4.1 billion) in Tharaka Nithi county. In Laikipia county, construction of Kahurura dam (Sh5.9 billion), Wiyumiririe(Sh1.5 billion) and Isiolo dam (Sh10 billion) has also been halted among others. Consequently, the MPs who sit in the Environment and Natural Resources committee also want the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to commence investigations ofÂ  projects being financed externally under the Engineering, Procurement Construction and Finance (EPCF) programme. The committee, chaired by Kareke Mbiuki, said the government ought to be serious in how it proceeds with the construction of the dams. The EPCF is a form of contracting arrangement where the contractor is made responsible for all the activities from design, procurement, construction, commissioning and hand over of the project to the end-user or including sourcing for their own finances to build he project. Arror and Kimwarer dams, whose construction is being done by an Italian company reportedly grappling with financial constraints, is currently the subject of investigation. At a meeting with Water Cabinet secretary Simon Chelugui, Kareke urged the government to ensure designs have been provided, cash for compensations is acquired and bidding is done before construction is commissioned. .
