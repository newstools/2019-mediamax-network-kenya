Irene Githinji @gitshee Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia (pictured) yesterday said plans are underway to fly  relatives of victims of Ethiopia Airline plane crash to Addis Ababa to help in identification of bodies. The CS said 25 out of the affected 32 families aboard the ill-fated Boeing 737 MAX-8 had been contacted and were in the process of reaching out to the remaining seven. A multi-sectoral team was formed on Sunday to help in co-ordinating issues connected to crash. The team comprises Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), National Disaster Management Unit, Kenya Airports Authority, Port Health and Air Accident Investigation officials. Family welfare Others in the team include Ethiopian Airlines, Kenya Airways, Kenya Airports Security Unit, Immigration and the Government Chemist. The CS said the government had given priority to the welfare of friends and families of the crash victims, including providing counselling and support services. KCAA Director of Air Safety Captain Tom Ogeche will lead the team to Ethiopia. Complex process The CS called for patience as investigations are carried out to establish the cause of the crash. “Investigations are still ongoing and these kind of things take time. We are therefore asking for patience to allow investigators and specialists to carry out the complex process,” said the CS. Macharia said that, by virtue of having the highest number of casualties and the airplane being destined for Nairobi, Kenya will play a central role in the investigations.
