London, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Unai Emery is not used to losing in the Europa League, but the Arsenal manager must summon a response from his team if they are to overturn a shock 3-1 defeat in the first leg of their last 16 tie with Rennes and remain in the hunt for a trophy in his first season with the Gunners. Emery won three consecutive Europa League titles with Sevilla between 2014 and 2016 and winning the competition once more would guarantee Arsenal a much-needed return to the Champions League next season after a two-year absence. Perfect preparation A 2-0 win over Manchester United at the Emirates on Sunday was perfect preparation for the Gunners, who moved into the Premier League top four and sent a warning to Rennes over the stark contrast between their form at home and on the road ahead of Thursday’s clash at the Emirates Stadium. Emery’s men have won 11 consecutive home games in the Premier League and Europa League since November, compared to three away wins in 12 matches on the road in the same period. But for a first-half red card shown to Sokratis Papastathopoulos 40 minutes into the first leg, Arsenal could have been much better placed to progress to the last eight. Provoked The visitors were leading 1-0 thanks to Alex Iwobi’s opener, but the Greek’s dismissal provoked a Rennes fightback and Emery is keen to ensure his side do not lose their heads chasing a comeback victory. “We know that for example on Thursday one match can change a lot with one red card or goal, so controlling our emotions is very important,” said Emery. Arsenal received a big boost on Tuesday with the news Alexandre Lacazette will be free to feature after his suspension for a red card against BATE Borisov in the last round was downgraded to a two-match ban, which has already been served. -AFP
