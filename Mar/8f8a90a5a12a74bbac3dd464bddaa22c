Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Rita Kavashe, Isuzu chief executive, argues that although women make up more than 50 per cent of the workforce, only 29 per cent of them hold senior management positions and less than five per cent of them are CEOs in Africa. Kavashe admits that after working for more than 22 years in the motor vehicle industry, she has seen how things have changed—and how they haven’t. “I’m still getting greetings like ‘Good morning gentlemen and Rita.” I can still recall the day, I was mistaken as the managing director’s secretary over the phone – because in the mind of whoever called, a woman could not possibly be an MD,” says Kavashe. “Companies whose boardrooms include women have improved financial performance and shareholder value, increased customer and employee value and a rising investor confidence,” she says. Kavashe advises women who encounter discrimination to never give up. Structural obstacles She says lack of access to formal networks by women is a structural obstacle to their career advancement, comparable in impact to lacking a mentor or appropriate coaching and training. Another impediment to women’s career advancement is motherhood. “Raising children takes up considerable time and energy, often at the expense of career growth. Striking the balance is not easy.” She calls on organisations to deliberately recognise the unique multifaceted roles women play in nurturing society as mothers and then blend this into the workplace. “At Isuzu, we have introduced flexi-hours for women who have returned from maternity leave. They can report to work outside the rush hour and leave earlier than what is the norm in other organisations,” she says.
