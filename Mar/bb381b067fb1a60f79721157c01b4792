Port Workers Welfare and Performance Group (PWWP) wants the government to expedite outstanding payment of performance bonus of over 7,000 port employees. They said the pending 2016-2017 inception payment performance has caused disquiet among  workers. In a joint statement released to the media by PWWP chairman Waweru Kamau, secretary Ali Khamis and organising secretary Peter Ouma said they are concerned with the delay by the National Treasury. “The delay had prompted Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku to hurriedly issue an internal circular to assure employees the process for release of the funds is at an advanced stage,” they said. The officials warned the government saying the delay in payment of the bonus could affect workers’ morale and affect their work in meeting target set by the government.
