George Kebaso @Morarak The prevailing drought conditions and long distances to polling stations will determine voter turnout in today’s Wajir West by-election. In what is turning out to be a two-horse race pitting Jubilee and Kanu candidates, both contestants have expressed fears that the turnout could be a fraction  of the 27, 504 registered voters. This is because the majority of the residents in the constituency—who mainly depend on the nomadic lifestyle—have been forced out in search of better conditions for their animals. Another issue is the vastness of the constituency that is spread on a 9,000-square kilometre area. Here, some polling stations are as far as 200km to the main tallying centre at the Griftu Livestock Training Institute in Wajir. Unlike in the General Election where results were relayed directly from polling stations to the National tallying centre, for this by-election, IEBC officials accompanied by security agents across the 75 polling stations would have to physically deliver the marked ballots to the tallying centre. Speaking to journalists at the main tallying centre, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati shrugged off these challenges saying that as usual, by-elections do not attract huge numbers of voters as witnessed in the general polls.
