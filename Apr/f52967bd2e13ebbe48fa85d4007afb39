Speaking after laying the foundation stone at the site yesterday, Governor Lee Kinyanjui said the bronze statue of the environmentalist, who died in 2011, will be part of the town’s Sh20 million rehabilitation programme. He said Nyayo Gardens will be turned into a modern green park with a variety of services. An information centre and a race track would also be established in the five-acre park on Kenyattta Avenue, the governor said. “When we started this project, some said it was not a priority but environmental matters are always a priority for us,” he said. Public participation Kinyanjui pledge that members of the public would be invited to give their views on how best to improve the gardens, which is also home to a World War II commemorative plaque. “We recognise that public participation is vital in such a  project. A portal will be opened to receive views from residents on how we can make it better,” said Kinyanjui.  He attributed clogging of the town’s drainage system to littering and urged residents to be more responsible.
