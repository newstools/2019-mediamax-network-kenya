Festus Kipchumba @PeopleDailyKe Some Baringo MPs openly clashed on Sunday over who, between Deputy President William Ruto and Senator Gideon Moi, will carry the day in 2022 presidential elections. Tiaty MP William Kamket (Kanu), a key ally of Moi, urged Ruto supporters to brace themselves for a political tsunami, saying the country’s political landscape was about to change. Speaking during a church service at Ossen in Baringo North, the MP likened Jubilee Party to a sinking ship. Steal show “Leaders in Jubilee should use this opportunity to cross over to the winning party instead of getting stuck in a party that seems to have lost track a long time ago,” he said. Kamket challenged his Baringo North colleague William Cheptumo of Jubilee to stay close to him to be on the safe side when things start falling apart in his party. Cheptumo, in response, said the only tsunami the country will witness will be that of unity and cohesion, which will heal the nation. “Jubilee party is intact and there is no way we will lose the 2022 presidential elections since our candidate, Deputy President William Ruto, will automatically succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta,” he added. Cheptumo said Jubilee’s popularity is growing unlike other parties and Kamket should also consider joining it as the party will be the best bet to steal the show in 2022. Baringo Woman Representative Gladwel Cheruiyot (Kanu) urged leaders to focus on service delivery. Governor Stanley Kiptis asked leaders to preach peace and unity  and focus on development.  He urged politicians to be careful not to throw the country into an electioneering mood.
