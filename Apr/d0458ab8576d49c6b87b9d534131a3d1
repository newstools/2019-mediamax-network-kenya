A company that was contracted by the Judiciary to construct a High Court in Maralal town, Samburu county, has been directed to complete the project within a year failure of  which the contract will be terminated and given to another firm. Chief Justice David Maraga said Debroso, the contracted firm, would be supervised by Judiciary officers and local leaders to ensure the court is completed within the specified time. “The contractor is on site but is not moving at the speed we want. My people told me he had capacity challenges and I had to come myself. We have been forced to scale down the project because given the pace at which it is moving, we are not going to complete it by December,” he said. Maraga was accompanied by Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda and area Women Representative Maison Leshoomo. Leshoomo said residents have been incurring high expenses in search of High Court services, which could have been avoided this year had the contractor  implemented the project within the required time. “Our people are suffering as they seek services from Nyeri, Nanyuki, Nyahururu,  Isiolo and Nakuru. We hope construction of this court within the required time will reduce the cost of seeking the services,” she said. Lesuuda said area leaders have agreed to cooperate with judicial officers to ensure construction of the court is completed and launched soon for the benefit of wananchi. “As residents, we know the importance of this court because services will come closer to the people. We have agreed to cooperate with Judiciary officers to ensure  construction of the court is completed within the year so people can enjoy services,” she said. Debroso company commenced the project in April 2017 and was scheduled to complete it  by October 2018. – KNA
