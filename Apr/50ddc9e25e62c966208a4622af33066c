Seth Onyango @sethmanex One of the young street-racing enthusiasts, who perished in a grisly accident during their annual Easter weekend event in Tanzania is a nephew to Kirinyanga Woman Representative Purity Ngirici. Yesterday, she took to Twitter to mourn her kin, Robin Njiru— one of the three who died on the spot in an accident that left five others fighting for their lives in hospital— and  described him “a sociable bubbly gentleman who, like any other young person, had great dreams for his future”. “The cruel hand of death has snatched my beloved Nephew Robin Njiru who perished in the Arusha-Namanga accident. Robin was a young man of virtue. I recall with nostalgia his passion for everything his mind set to do”. Meanwhile, police in Tanzania are set to conclude investigations into the grisly accident. Kajiado Police Commander Beatrice Gachago told the People Daily they are awaiting a report from their counterparts in Tanzania on what exactly happened. “We haven’t received information from our colleagues in Tanzania…the accident was far away from the border,” she said. Kajiado Deputy County Commissioner Charles Wambugu had earlier said one Kenyan and two Tanzanians died during the unofficial racing competition dubbed “The Arusha Drive 3.0” and which had attracted racers from both Kenya and Tanzania. Arusha Police Commander Jonathan Shanna said the accident occurred after two speeding saloon cars collided and veered off road, ramming spectators. Many of the dead are believed to have been spectators, even though photos from the event showed several bodies being pulled out of the mangled wreckage. Three people are said to have died on the spot while five others were critically injured.
