Alvin Mwangi Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers (Kuppet) National Governing Council will move to court next week to challenge the government’s decision to implement housing levy on grounds that it will lead to over taxation of Kenyans. The union, through its Secretary General Akello Misori said it has enough reasons to file a new suit just a day after Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) applied to be allowed to withdraw from the case. “During the mention of the case yesterday, Employment and Labour Relations Court gave the green- light to all parties who have concerns about the Housing Levy Fund to file new suits,” said Misori. Further, the union said the new suit would not interfere with the order issued by the court last week where it temporarily suspended deduction of 1.5 per cent from employees. On Friday, the High Court declined to lift orders barring government from deducting 1.5 per cent from salaries until the dispute is fully solved.
