Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Top leadership of the National Assembly will this weekend deliberate on the current political divisions as well as the budget-making process during a retreat in Mombasa. Sources within Parliament revealed that the leaders will discuss a way forward in a bid to cool down political  temperatures being experienced. The meeting comes against a backdrop of political differences between MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto, popularly known as “Team Tanga Tanga” and those purportedly supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta known as “Team Kieleweke”. Already, MPs allied to Ruto have been holding meetings to strategise on “how to teach the executive a lesson” for allegedly mistreating them and failing to address their welfare issues. During the retreat set to start on Friday, the team will also deliberate on the budget cycle, especially now that the High Court issued a ruling prohibiting the National Treasury from collecting taxes before the Finance Bill is passed. In September last year, High Court Judge Winfrida Okwany ruled that the government cannot budget for what it has not financed. Yesterday, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said the team will also discuss the rising national debt and the population census exercise, set for August.
