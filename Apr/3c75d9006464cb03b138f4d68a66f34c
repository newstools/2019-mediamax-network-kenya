Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday visited retired President Moi at his Kabarak home  and condoled with the family following the death of his eldest son, Jonathan Toroitich Moi, in a Nakuru hospital on Friday. Uhuru was received by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, who is also Kanu chairman, even as plans for Jonathan’s burial picked momentum.  “JT’s (as Jonathan was commonly known) word was always his bond, he was dependable,” said Uhuru. “Many of us will always remember JT for his pioneering exploits in motorsport as a rally driver and as a successful farmer, businessman and entrepreneur.” Uhuru assured the family of his support, saying Jonathan was his friend and brother. According to sources privy to funeral plans, Jonathan will be accorded a State funeral with high-profile leaders such as Uganda President Yoweri Museveni expected to attend. The Moi family is expected to hold its first meeting today, a few hours after Senator Moi jetted back into the country from an official trip. “From today’s meeting we’ll get a tentative date but it must be convenient to the Head of State and the former President,” said the source. Senator Moi eulogised his brother earlier, in a statement, as  a selfless family man, amiable, social and down-to-earth and an industrious human being. At Jonathan’s home in Kabimoi, Eldama Ravine, in Baringo county, mourners continued streaming in with many eulogising him as a people’s man, friendly and outgoing. Jonathan, who gained fame because of his exploits in Safari Rally, was a farmer. He also vied for Eldama Ravine parliamentary seat unsuccessfully in 1997 and 2002 elections. He kept a low-profile thereafter. Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, who visited the home two days ago, said his administration will work with the national government to give JT a befitting send-off, adding that he will be remembered as talented rally driver.
