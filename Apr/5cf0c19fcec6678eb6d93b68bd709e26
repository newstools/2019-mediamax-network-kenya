National handball women’s team coach Jack Ochieng is set to name his final squad for the All Africa Games qualifiers before the team travels to Uganda tomorrow for the April 22-28 event set to take place at the Makerere University Indoor Stadium in Kampala. A provisional team of 18 has been in non-residential training for close to eight weeks. Dominating the list are Nairobi Water and National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) players led by goalkeepers Winnie Miyienda, Modesta Auma, both from league champions Water, and Cereals’ Regina Waithera. Kenyatta University’s Mercy Katola and Ulinzi Shark’s Sarah Wasike are the only players outside the two clubs that made it to the provisional squad. Raring to go The competition will bring together 10 nations which include Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Sudan, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and hosts Uganda as they fight for a slot to represent the zone at the continental games. On their 12th edition, the African Games will take place in Rabat and Casablanca, Morocco between August 23 and September 3. “We have had time to train. The other advantage is that all the players were still active in the Premier League and are in good shape. They are raring to go,” said Ochieng. His charges head to the qualifiers as Zone Five defending champions, having won the title during the last qualifiers. “Since 2003, the team has not missed the All Africa Games and we head to Uganda with a mission in mind, qualifying and defending our Zone Five title,” he added. In the last edition of the games held in Congo Brazzaville, Kenya finished 10th with Angola crowned champions. The team’s best performance at the games was seventh place in 2011.
