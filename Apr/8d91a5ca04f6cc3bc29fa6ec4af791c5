Murang’a county health executive Joseph Mbai has raised alarm over increased cases of teenage pregnancies. Speaking during a youth sensitisation forum, Mbai said the number of girls getting pregnant between 10 and 18 years has risen significantly. “This is a matter of concern that needs to be addressed and drastic measures taken to curb the vice,” he said. Mbai added that most girls are easily lured especially during school holidays and perpetrators go unpunished with some getting out-of-court settlements with the families of the victims. “We have taken up some cases and we will ensure perpetrators are arrested and prosecuted,” he said. Meanwhile, nominated MCA Mary Waithira has decried increased cases of defilement and urged law enforcers to arrest sex pests.
