Tom Rachuonyo A national cultural and heritage museum in Nyatike sub-county, Migori, has been upgraded to international status. During the international celebration of world heritage sites on Friday, Sports Chief Administrative Secretary Hassan Noor urged area residents to support the 12th century-old ruins of Thimlich Ohinga. He made the remarks in a speech, on behalf of Sports Cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed. Noor said the cultural site that is now internationally recognised would offer residents job opportunities. He urged politicians not to fight efforts to upgrade the historical museum, saying the government is committed to ensuring unemployed school leavers are engaged in income-generating activities to empower them economically. National Museums director general Mzalendo Kibunjia, who had accompanied Noor, said the government will improve all historical centres in the country to attract tourists, which will enable various parts of the nation to earn revenue. Former Nyatike MP Omondi Anyanga hailed the Handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila odinga, saying it had  reduced tension and conflict in the nation. He urged residents to support Uhuru’s initiatives and ignore incitement from leaders out to wreck the nation for personal gains. Dignitaries who attended the event raised concerns over the dispute surrounding Migingo Island and urged relevant authorities to resolve the dispute once and for all as fishermen from the Kenyan side were being harassed by foreign forces while on fishing expeditions.
