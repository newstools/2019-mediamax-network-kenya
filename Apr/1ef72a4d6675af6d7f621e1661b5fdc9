Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga Students in private schools can now access the National Hospital Insurance Fund medical cover similar to their counterparts in the public school. This after the Kenya Private Schools Association (KPSA) in partnership with Minet Kenya Consulting launched a medical insurance scheme targeting the students. The scheme will cover management of medical emergencies that could arise in and out of school including trauma, asthma attacks, hypertensive crises, diabetic crises, severe allergic reactions and severe food poisoning. It will also cover management of routine medical conditions that occur frequently, are not life threatening but need prompt management. Scheme launch Speaking during the launch of the scheme in Mombasa, Kenya Private Schools Association national chairperson Mutheu Kasanga said the scheme aims at protecting the children who are venerable to diseases due to their low immunity. “This scheme gives students in private schools  peace of mind while performing their duties,” she said.
