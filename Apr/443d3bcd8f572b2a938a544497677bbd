Douglas Dindi and DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Deputy President William Ruto said yesterday that the government’s internship programme would officially kick off after July. He said the programme has been factored in the budget, adding that students in agricultural colleges would also benefit from the programme. “Internship provides additional training and opportunity for students graduating from colleges to expand their knowledge and experience,” he said. Ruto spoke in Kakamega during Bukura Agricultural College 23rd graduation ceremony. He warned that continued dependency on rainfall could depress farmers productivity and inhibit the achievement of President Uhuru Kenytta’s Big 4 agenda pillar on food security.
