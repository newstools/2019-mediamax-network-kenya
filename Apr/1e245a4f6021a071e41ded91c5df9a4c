Two people died while 10 others are fighting for their lives at Guru Nanak and Kenyatta National hospitals after the driver of the matatu they were travelling in lost control and plunged into a valley in Karura Forest on Kiambu Road. Witnesses said the Kiambu-bound 14-seater Public Service Vehicle rolled several times downhill before landing into the ditch. The roof was ripped off and the seats were completely destroyed. “Two people perished while 10 sustained injuries. Those injured sustained limb fractures, deep cuts and soft tissue injuries,” a scene of crime police officer said.  The driver and conductor of the Marafiki Sacco matatu were  among those injured. However, Starehe sub-county police commander Alice Kimeli did not confirm the number of fatalities or survivors, saying they were yet to get actual information of the casualties. According to witnesses, the driver was trying to overlap  when it skidded down the valley. The wreckage was towed to Muthaiga Police Station.
