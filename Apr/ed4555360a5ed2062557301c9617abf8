Bernard Gitau and Christine Musa @PeopleDailyKe Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki has directed the closure of all unlicensed food joints and hotels in the country after the recent cholera outbreak. The directive comes after a staff of the Nairobi Hospital died of cholera on Monday and scores more were admitted to the facility. Yesterday, another death related to cholera was reported in Kajiado. Poor sanitation “Officials from Ministry of Health and county government toured the Nairobi Hospital and confirmed 50 cases of cholera,” she said. Though she said the situation is “reasonably under control”, Kariuki said the cases of cholera can be traced to Machakos, Kajiado and Narok. She attributed the outbreak to poor sanitation and called upon county governments and other partners to collaborate to combat the spread. “There is need for counties to step up their surveillance. As a precautionary measure, all unlicensed hotels and joints handling food must be closed down,” she said. In Kajiado Health County Executive member Esther Somoire said a woman from Ongata Rongai Kajiado succumbed to cholera. The woman is a known food vendor at Ongata Rongai and is said to have fetched drinking water from Marikiti market. “About 17 people tested positive for cholera and three patients are still admitted at different health facilities in Kajiado North Sub-county,” she said. Meanwhile, Nairobi Hospital yesterday sacked its chief executive Gordon Odundo, who has been on compulsory leave since December 2018 to allow for an audit of the facility’s tendering activities. In an internal memo to its staff, board chairman John Simba said the hospital would recruit a new CEO effectively replacing Odundo. Additional reporting by George Kebaso
