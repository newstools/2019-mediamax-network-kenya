Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority is set to roll out a major drive today aimed at reuniting Kenyans with their unclaimed assets worth billions of shillings. Chief Executive Officer, John Mwangi said the authority will kick off the first phase of the campaign in Mombasa, Kwale and Taita Taveta counties. He said it is important for people to go to the organisation’s website, www.ufaa.go.ke, and search if they are listed on the database showing that they have assets which they have not collected. A statement from the authority said it currently holds unclaimed cash valued at Sh13.1 billion, 1,451 safe deposit boxes and Sh555.5 million units of shares made up of unclaimed dividends, shares, wages, dormant bank accounts, gift vouchers and life insurance policies. –ZACHARY OCHUODHO
