A clearing and forwarding agent, who had been charged with trafficking in Sh109 million ivory in a Mombasa Law Court was yesterday acquitted for lack of evidence. Senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia cleared  Ephantus Gitonga of all charges on grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove that the suspect was dealing in wildlife trophies without licence from the Kenya Wildlife Service. The magistrate said he had established that the accused was a clearing agent, and had no link to the 335 pieces of ivory haul seized at the port of Mombasa.“The prosecution has not proved the charges against the suspect and I hereby acquit him,” said the magistrate. Kyambia said the prosecution did not prove that Gitonga, as a clearing agent, had a prior knowledge of the contents of the container which had been shipped from Uganda by Eshipina trading company. He said experts in wildlife trophies, who testified informed the court that the ivory had been sourced from Tanzania and Uganda.
