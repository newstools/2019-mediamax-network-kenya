Bernard Gitau and Mercy Gacheche @PeopleDailyKe Kenya has petitioned the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to have elephants in South Africa and three other countries listed as critically endangered. Tourism Cabinet secretary Najib Balala said other 34 African countries  support Kenya’s proposal. “We have submitted proposals to CITES to have a section of animals listed in the list of critically endangered species and also to have trade regulated for some species,” he said. Four countries Speaking yesterday at KWS headquarters during the Huduma Namba registration, Balala said only four countries in Africa — South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe —  are yet to list elephants as critically endangered species, thus encouraging ivory trade. In January, Kenya submitted five proposals to have the African elephants, giraffes, pancake tortoise, wedge fish and sea cucumbers listed as at risk of extinction. Meanwhile, Balala has expressed concern over high cost of compensation claims due to human-wildlife conflict. The CS said compensation claims currently stand at Sh7 billion.
