Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Governors who in the past recorded statements with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) should brace themselves for any eventuality after their files were forwarded to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). This came as the commission yesterday insisted that it is currently reviewing all corruption cases involving 20 sitting and former governors to fast-track the files which have been pending for years. According to a source who did not want to be named, if the DPP approves their files, some of the high-profile individuals may be arraigned in court as early as next week. “They are likely to face accusations including failure to comply with the law relating to the management of public funds and fraudulent acquisition of public property,” the source familiar with the investigations at EACC said yesterday. It is also closing in on at least 227 members of the county assembly for various omissions and unethical behaviour. New cases Reacting to yesterday’s edition of the People Daily, a commission official said they are not working on new cases but old and active files contrary to an impression created by our story titled; Over 20 governors stare at graft-related charges, that those mentioned had been recently grilled. He, however, added that the commission has fast tracked the cases that have been pending for several years. The source added that some of the cases—except those Samburu governor Moses Lenolkulal and Okoth Obado (Migori)—date back to 2013 when EACC recorded statements from the affected persons. Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero’s case is already before court. Others who have recorded statements with EACC include Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Martin Wambora (Embu), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Mwangi wa Iria (Murang’a), Samuel Ragwa (Tharaka Nithi), Godana Doyo (Isiolo), Sospeter Ojaamong(Busia) and Nathif Jama (Garissa).
