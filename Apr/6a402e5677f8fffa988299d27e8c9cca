Former Harambee Stars player George Owino has been banned from all football-related activities for 10 years and fined Sh1.5 million by FIFA over match-fixing. Fifa made the ruling on its website, “The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has found nine individuals – eight players/former players as well as one players’ agent – guilty of having been involved in match manipulation in violation of art. 69 par. 1 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (Unlawfully influencing match results).” It added, “Owino has also been banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at both national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) for a period of ten (10) years.” In addition, a fine in the amount of CHF 15,000 has been imposed upon him.” The decisions were notified to the individual concerned today, the date on which the relevant bans come into force. In its 10-page preliminary report dated September 2018, Fifa had accused the Harambee Stars defender of masterminding match manipulation with one ”high-profile international match-fixer Mr. Wilson Raj Perumal,” between 2009 and 2011. From the report, Fifa cited 14 matches which Owino featured in and which they were investigating. In its report, the world football governing body also mentioned a Pascal, a Julius and an Edgar, who all featured for Harambee Stars during the said period.
