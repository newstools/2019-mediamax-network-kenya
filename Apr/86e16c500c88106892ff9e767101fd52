The African Union has condemned the military takeover in Sudan, according to a statement. “Military take over is not the appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people”, chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said in the statement. Specifically he criticised an “unconstitutional change of government”. He added that the Peace and Security Council will “meet swiftly” to make appropriate decisions. -BBC
