Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho For every Sh100 collected by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Sh30 goes towards servicing public debt which stood at Sh5.15 billion as at September last year. The public debt is a mix of Sh2.54 trillion domestic debt and Sh2.61 trillion external debt as at last year with public debt versus the gross domestic product per capita standing at Sh180,839. The revelation by Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) indicates that every Kenyan needs to pay Sh108,500 in order to clear the country’s public debt which has risen from Sh4.58 trillion recorded in November 2017 to Sh5.15 billion in September last year. IEA programme coordinator John Mutua said Kenya risks defaulting its loan service obligations unless it manages its debt portfolio well. “Debt service is expected to increase by 34.1 per cent in 2019/20 and given that there is drought, interest payment will increase by 31 per cent from Sh305.1 billion in the revised budget of 2017/18 to 399.98 billion in 2018/19,” he said. Kenya’s public debt mix, that is external versus internal changed from 59:41 in 2002 to 51:49 last year against debt strategy target mix of 60:40. Mutua said the government has continued to breach what is stated in the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) thereby going for more expensive loans both externally and locally. Treasury bonds He said while the government strategy target is to borrow 80 per cent of domestic debt through treasury bonds and 20 per cent through treasury bills, it instead opts to go for expensive treasury bills which mature fast and that are paid with high-interest rates as opposed to bonds which take longer to mature and charge  less interest rate. “Borrowing through Treasury bills has risen from Sh23 billion in 2010 to Sh38 billion in 2018, while Treasury bonds which stood at Sh74 billion in 2010 have reduced to Sh60 billion in 2018,” said Mutua. He said Kenya’s external debt is also increasingly shifting to commercial banks – Euro Bond – which is also expensive as opposed to multilateral borrowing which is slightly less expensive and takes longer to repay. “Multilateral debt – which takes longer to mature and charges low-interest rates have declined from Sh63 billion in 2013 to Sh34 billion in 2018, while the bilateral and commercial bank debts have also increased during the same period,” said Mutua. Loans from China has risen to Sh634.4 billion which is about 70.6 per cent of Kenya’s external debt followed by Japan with Sh104.7 billion (11.7 per cent), France at Sh62.6 (seven per cent), Germany at Sh35 billion (3.9 per cent), Italy at Sh15.6 billion (1.7 per cent), Belgium at Sh8 billion (0.9 per cent), and US Sh2.6 billion (0.3 per cent). Noah Wamalwa assistant programme officer at IEA said the government’s expenditure has persistently been on the rise over the past decade from 22.3 per cent of the total revenue generated (GDP) in 2008/09 to 27 per cent of the GDP in 2017/18. Wamalwa said the expenditure has been growing at a faster pace than revenue, widening deficits from 6.1 per cent in 2013/14 to 9.1 per cent in 2016/17, but dipped markedly to 7.6 per cent in 2017/18.
