Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Elgeyo Marakwet county minister for Roads and Public Works Kevin Biwott has obtained a court order stopping impeachment proceedings against him. Biwott, who had been summoned by an ad hoc committee to defend himself against several accusations, appeared before the committee on Monday with a court order issued by Justice Hellen Omondi of the  High Court in Eldoret on April 12. The order prohibits the committee from summoning Biwott pending inter partes hearing and determination of the matter on April 24. Biwott has named the Assembly, the Speaker, the Clerk and the committee as respondents. Governor Alex Tolgos and his administration have been enjoined as interested parties in the case. Standing orders According to the order seen by People Daily, the applicant said the motion violated Order 66 of the Assembly’s Standing Orders. “There is likelihood of bias since the respondents are playing roles of investigators, prosecutors and judges which is in complete violation of the principle of natural justice,” he said. Biwott is accused of, among other issues, refusing to pick  MCAs’ phone calls and failing to attend Cabinet meetings. But the CEC accuses the committee chaired by Soy South MCA Jonah Tanui of being motivated by politics. In a sworn affidavit, Biwott says the process was purely political.
