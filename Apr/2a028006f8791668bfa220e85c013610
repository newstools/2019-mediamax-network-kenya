Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A powerful watchdog committee of the National Assembly is set to begin fresh investigations into the Sh3.2 billion Ruaraka land saga. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chaired by Opiyo Wandayi said it has resolved to carry out the probe after Auditor General Edward Ouko raised queries over the compensation of the land where Ruaraka High School and Drive Inn Primary School sit. Wandayi said the team would make sure it exercises its constitutional mandate and examine the matter with diligence and bring it to a logical conclusion Land grabbed The 13.5 acres occupied by Ruaraka and Drive Inn Primary School under probe is part of 96 acres  of land which also include 37 acres occupied by General Service Unit, 59 acres used for the expansion of Outering Road and chiefs camp while the rest was grabbed by squatters. “With the release of the Auditor General’s report on the National Land Commission financial statement for 2017/18 financial year, the PAC is now fully seized of the Ruaraka land matter,” he said. Speaking yesterday, the Ugunja MP said  the verdict by PAC on the land will supersede all previous recommendations by any other committees of the two Houses of Parliament. He said unlike other investigations, PAC will not spare anyone in its efforts to get to the bottom of the matter and thus urged the public to be assured of thorough investigations. The probe on the land has been done by both Lands committee of the National Assembly chaired by Kitui South MP Rachel Nyamai and Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) chaired by Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwang.
