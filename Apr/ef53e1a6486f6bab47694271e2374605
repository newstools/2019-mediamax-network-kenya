Mutwiri Muriithi @mutwirimuriithi Britam Tower has clinched the inaugural overall Category Award for Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) Engineering at the Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Awards Ceremony. The Council of Tall Building and Urban Habitat is an annual award programme that recognises projects and individuals that have made extraordinary contributions to the advancement of tall buildings and the urban environment, while achieving sustainability at the highest and broadest level. The objective is to deliver a comprehensive and sophisticated view of these important buildings, space and technologies, while advocating for improvements in every aspect of their performance, especially those that have the greatest effect on the people who use them everyday. This means that the buildings highlighted are often not the tallest in a given year, but represent the best qualities and innovations in the typology. “We are delighted to have received this prestigious global award. Our goal was to put up a multi-tenanted iconic office building that embodied the qualities of strength and stability, to be an inspirational and environmentally responsible place ,” said Britam Group managing director Benson Wairegi. “Britam Tower’s strategic balance of rainwater harvesting, ventilation and passive heat mitigation strategies saved 39 per cent on energy and 50 per cent on water use compared to a typical building. The ‘veil’ faced solution consisting of 50 millimeter square ceramic rods in front of a full-height glass curtain wall with ‘selective’ glass, let in significantly more light then heat,” said the panel of experts.
