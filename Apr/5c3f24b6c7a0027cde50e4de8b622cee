Marsabit county has enhanced the fight against the kala-azar disease in Laisamis sub-county. County Health executive Jamah Wolde said an intense vector spraying exercise against the sand fly has commenced in Loglogo and Laisamis locations, which are the worst affected by the outbreak. Wolde said the spraying exercise targets 200 houses in the two areas, where new cases have been reported this week. He said 40 hotspots have been identified and the county government aims at distributing 500 treated mosquito nets for residents to protect themselves against the sand fly. The executive added that the devolved unit has spent more than Sh40 million to attend to more than 200 cases since the outbreak was reported a month ago. “A single dose for Kala-azar treatment costs about Sh200,000 and we are also engaged in sensitisation campaigns and issuance of treated mosquito nets,” he said. He said there were 27 admission cases: 20 at Laisamis Level 4 Hospital and seven at Marsabit County Referral Hospital despite relentless efforts to bring the situation under control. Wolde urged the national government, donors and other stakeholders in the health sector to chip in and help in containing the disease, which has claimed four lives.He lauded  Kenya Red Cross and Concern WorldWide for availing vehicles to help in transport logistics.
