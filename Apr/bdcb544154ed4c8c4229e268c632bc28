Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Embu Governor Martin Wambora was at pains yesterday to explain how his government spent  Sh468 million of county Revenue Fund (CRF). Appearing before County Public Accounts and Investment Committee to answer to audit queries, Wambora said he was unaware of how the money was collected and eventually spent by his county officials. Committee chairperson Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ took issue with the governor for what he termed as “improbable way” of managing public resources. He said the county chief may be out of touch with realities in his government, as a result, some officials may be using the opportunity to loot public funds.
