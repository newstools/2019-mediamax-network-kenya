Zachary Ochuodho Kenya’s export earnings from African countries declined to Sh216.2 billion in 2018 from Sh224.86 billion  recorded in 2017 despite registering an increase in total export earnings across the world. The Economic Survey 2019, says Kenya’s export earnings from Europe was Sh152.7 billion, United States Sh55.9 billion, East Africa Community (EAC) Sh129 billion, Africa Sh216.2 billion, Asia Sh63.71 billion and Middle East 180.9 billion. Increased competition Kenya’s total export value to Africa which hit Sh242.2 billion in 2016 has been on the decline for the three consecutive years, the survey indicates. Statistics indicates, for instance, the export value to the EAC region declined by 59.7 per cent from Sh131.6 billion in 2017 to Sh129 billion in 2018 due to increased competition. The economic survey says the total export earnings from countries such as Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and East Africa Community (EAC) declined by 23.3 per cent, 19.6 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively in 2018. Analysis of the data indicates that the value of exports to Tanzania grew by 4.3 per cent to Sh29.752 billion, Rwanda increased by 4.2 per cent, Uganda remained constant at Sh61.876 billion. Exports to South Sudan, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, DRC declined by 22.6 per cent, 3.8 per cent and 19.6 per cent to Sh12.9 billion, Sh160.0 billion and Sh15.2 billion in 2018 respective. However, the export earnings to South Africa improved significantly by 59 per cent to Sh4.4 billion in 2018 mainly on account of re-exports of machinery to the country. The export to Egypt also grew by 5.8 per cent to Sh20.1 billion in 2018, The value of exports to Somalia declined from Sh19.7 billion in 2017 to Sh15.1 billion 2018. Expenditure on imports from Africa rose by 2.7 per cent from Sh 200.5 billion in 2017 to Sh205.9 billion in 2018, accounting for 11.7 per cent of total imports. Export earnings Sachen Gudka, chairman of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), attributes the decline in Kenya’s export earnings from Africa to the stiff competition from other areas across the world. Gudka said the locally manufactured goods cannot compete effectively with their counterparts in the region mainly  as a result of  the high cost of production in the country. He said Kenya is 13 per cent cost disadvantaged compared to other countries hence the cognition for having more expensive goods. “The high cost of energy makes Kenyan products expensive at the African market and therefore uncompetitive when they are exported to Comesa, EAC and other African countries,” he says.
