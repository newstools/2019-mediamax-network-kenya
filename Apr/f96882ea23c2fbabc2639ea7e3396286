Oliver Musembi and Mathew Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKe Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina and area residents have raised the red flag over an alleged scheme to grab a 10-acre public cemetery. This comes after residents chased away Kiambu County government workers, who were putting up a perimeter wall last week at the public facility. Wainaina and the residents accused the county government of ganging up with some individuals to annex the cemetery for commercial use. Speaking while issuing bursary cheques at General Kago Primary School, the MP claimed some county officials, including a powerful politician, were behind the plan to grab the land. However, Thika Town administrator Ephraim Njihi dismissed the claims, saying fencing of the burial site was a security measure that had been politicised. “We decided to construct the wall after Mount Kenya University students complained to the county government over increased insecurity cases,” he said. Area deputy county commissioner Douglas Mutai said he was not aware of any security threats around the cemetery, but welcomed the move by the county government to secure it “if it was in good faith”.
