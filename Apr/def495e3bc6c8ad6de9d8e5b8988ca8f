Chaos, violence and intimidation marked Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) elections in Kirinyaga. The election held at Kerugoya Catholic Hall was characterised by fist fights and name-calling with two people sustaining injuries when two groups went for each other’s throats. Former KNCCI chairman John Kabui and a Mombasa-based businessman Waweru Njogu were engaged in a fierce duel, which disrupted the elections for the better part of the day. Anti-riot police, led by Kerugoya deputy OCPD, were deployed to quell the situation after supporters of the two groups clashed and two men sustained facial injuries after they were attacked with a blunt object. The elections were delayed for more than eight hours after the two groups failed to agree on the membership and sanctity of the voting register. Elections, however, kicked off at around 6pm with more than 500 members participating in the elections.Voting went into the wee hours of Friday with results being announced a few minutes after 3.00am Speaking after he was declared winner, Njogu said he is determined to change the fortunes of the business lobby.  He garnered 255 votes against Kabui’s 210 votes. He said many traders in the county are facing several challenges, including high licence fees, and pledged to address such issues. However, Kabui termed the elections a sham, saying voters were bribed and intimidated to vote in a certain way. Poline Wangeci was elected vice chair with 231 votes against Jennifer Wanjiru’s 211.
