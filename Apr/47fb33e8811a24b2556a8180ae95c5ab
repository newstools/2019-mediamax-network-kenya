Mathew Ndung’u Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has defended his government against alleged corruption dealings and for flouting procurement procedures. He termed the arrest of two Kiambu county officials on Thursday by DCI officers where Sh40,000 and $670 were recovered as politically-motivated. The two officials—Finance chief officer Faith Njeri Harrison and her driver Harrison Kung’u—were arrested along Mpaka Road in Parklands in a Toyota double cabin. Also found in the car is a United Nations rubber stamp. Car registration Detectives said a search on the database of National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) revealed that the vehicle was not bearing genuine registration numbers. Waititu (pictured) claims police officers conducting the operation added unfounded accusations on the suspects, saying it’s not a crime for a woman to have money in the car. Speaking after launching new Juja sub-county headquarters on Saturday, Waititu hit at his opponents saying they are politicising war on graft  to paralyse operations of the county. He decried that Kiambu has become a hub of all fake news bloggers who he said misrepresented facts by dragging his name in the arrest of the county officers.
