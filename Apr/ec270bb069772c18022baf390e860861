PD Team @PeopleSports11 Wazito and Ushuru are back to the top of the National Super League table after taking advantage of Kisumu Allstars’ draw in midweek matches played yesterday. Ghanaian import Paul Acquah’s first-half strike was enough to silence eighth-placed Bidco United and give Wazito a 1-0 win which moves them top of the 20-team log with 55 points. Chances were few and far between with Bidco defending in numbers whenever they did not have the ball while Wazito attacked through wingers Wilson Anekeya and Joseph Waithira and forwards Victor Ndinya and Derrick Onyango. Meanwhile, Ushuru moved to second, also on 55 points, after beating a Administration Police 2-1 courtesy of goals from Victor Ayugi and Brian Yakhama. Allstars were the biggest losers of the day as they dropped from first to third following a 1-1 result against Kibera Black Stars which left them on 54 points, just one behind the joint leaders. Other results Meanwhile, a penalty for either side saw Shabana FC and rivals Eldoret Youth draw 1-1 at Gusii Stadium. Shabana conceded an early penalty and a red card after Anthony Chingwa converted to give Eldoret the lead in the 18th minute but the hosts pushed hard and earned a spot kick of their own a few minutes to half-time, Wycliffe Nyangechi calmly making it 1-1. The result left Shabana at eighth position on the log with 41 points while Eldoret Youth are 11th with 35 points. There was another stalemate in Kakamega when visiting FC Talanta  fought from one goal down to hold struggling Green Commandos 2-2 at Bukhungu Stadium. Castro Likhanga converted the penalty to give Green Commandos the lead, having been brought down inside the box by Joseph Wamalwa, but Talanta responded instantly through Brian Ouma. Talanta then took a deserved 2-1 lead at the stroke of half-time through Chris Owino’s stunner but Griffin Ouma equalied after the break. Reports by Barry Silah, Fred Likuyani and Gibo Zachary
