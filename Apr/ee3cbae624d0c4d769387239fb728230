Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge says he expects negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a new stand-by loan facility to conclude in months. “We discussed the general direction” of the facility in Washington last week, said Njoroge  (pictured) on Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We expect it to be concluded in the next few months.” Njoroge said the government is seeking a facility aligned to what it had before to be drawn upon in the event of shocks that cannot be dealt with using normal measures. Kenya’s previous facility of $1.5 billion (Sh151.9 billion) expired in September. There is no rush in terms of balance-of-payments needs, Njoroge said. Kenya wants to have ownership of the programme and policies that support it. “That’s what we are discussing,” he said. Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of black tea, one of its main sources of foreign currency, and is facing a prolonged dry spell that has left more than one million people in need of food aid. The government forecasts economic expansion of 6.3 per cent this year, but if delayed rainfall ends up being a “severe drought,” it could take about one percentage point off that growth rate, according to Njoroge. Negotiations for the IMF facility are happening as the government plans to sell $2 billion (Sh202.5 billion) of Eurobonds this year. Njoroge said the proceeds will be used to refinance debt due in June. –BLOOMBERG
