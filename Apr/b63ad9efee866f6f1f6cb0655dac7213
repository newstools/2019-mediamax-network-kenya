Pascal Sala Artiste Alvin aka Alvindo is being sought by police for failure to honour summons issued by Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB). Two weeks ago, the singer was given 14 days to appear before the board failure to which legal action would be taken against him. This was after KFCB banned his song titled Takataka produced at FastCash Music Group, which was termed to be “characterised by crude language that objectifies women and glorifies hurting them as a normal reaction to rejection of overtures by men.” Alvindo and his producer are said to have switched off their phones to avoid being tracked by police. KFCB CEO Ezekiel Mutua on Saturday wrote on Twitter that the board had recorded a statement with the police after the singer failed to appear before it. “We recorded a statement with the @PoliceKE after the singer and his producers failed to honour the 14-day summons. Now we are waiting for @DCI_Kenya to arrest and charge these guys in court. Their phones have been off and they cannot perform anywhere in Kenya,” read the post. Mutua has also pleaded with the public to provide police with information of whereabouts of Alvindo, which would help them to arrest him. “Anyone who knows a performance anywhere in the country by @alvindotaka can inform us or the @PoliceKE,” added Mutua. Besides failing to honour the summons, the upcoming musician is also wanted for defying the ban by releasing a music video of the song, soon after its banning. In the ban, the KFCB boss warned the song should not be performed live or broadcast anywhere within the Republic of Kenya, and that no deejay should play it either on a broadcast station or in entertainment joints. Meanwhile, KFCB is in possession of over 230 DVD copies of Takataka impounded in Malindi and other parts of the country. The board said it would use the materials as exhibits to prosecute the culprits.
