Festus Kipchumba and Jacob Songok @PeopleDailyKe Baringo county leaders have called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare the drought affecting various parts of the country a national disaster. Addressing the press in Mogotio, the politicians led by Governor Stanley Kiptis, said many people were at the risk of starving, adding that livestock were dying in large numbers.  The leaders said the drought would get the necessary attention if the President declared it a disaster. Kiptis also appealed for donations to affected families. He said many families were relying on food rations from the government for survival. Insecurity “For the past six months, we have not received any rains and this has led to shortage of water and food for people and livestock,” said Kiptis. Baringo South MP Charles Kamuren said the drought could contribute to insecurity  as residents scramble for pasture and water. In Garissa, Hulugho MCA Adow Omar yesterday asked the government to send water trucks to the area.  Speaking to the press after touring affected areas, Omar said there were only two water trucks serving the ward.
