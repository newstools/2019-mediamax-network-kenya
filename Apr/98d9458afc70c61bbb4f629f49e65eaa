Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe MCAs from Ugenya sub-county in Siaya have resolved their differences with Governor Cornel Rasanga after the latter reneged on his threats to deny them development funds. Rasanga had threatened to withhold the funds after MCAs allegedly failed to vote for ODM candidate Chris Karan in the recent by-election that saw David Ochieng emerge victorious. MCAs Oduor Odongo (West Ugenya), Fredrick Omoro (East Ugenya) and Benard Adala (nominated) said apology by Rasanga have ended the bad blood between residents and the county leadership. “The residents were bitter with Rasanga,” they said, adding that lack of development would have jeopardised their re-election ambitions. Rasanga apologised to the residents while in East Ugenya last weekend. He told them they would benefit from development projects like all other sub-counties and congratulated the residents for voting for Ochieng. “I want to take this chance to apologise for my utterances. Ugenya is in Siaya and just like the rest of the sub-counties, residents deserve development projects,” he  said.
