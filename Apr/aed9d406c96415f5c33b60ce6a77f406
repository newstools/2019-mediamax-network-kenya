The Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti has revealed that last week’s Barclays Bank of Kenya ATM heist was planned by employees of the financial institution, who used outsiders to execute the theft. Kinoti hinted that investigations into the Sh11 million theft are almost complete with several suspects in custody. Conceal evidence He said the elaborate scheme involved smearing CCTV cameras with petroleum jelly to blur visibility and failing to guard the ATMs to aid stealing. Kinoti said investigations show that the stolen money was to be shared among the bank’s employees and the outsiders. Reports had indicated that cyber crime detectives suspect that three robbers might have jack-potted the ATMs to split money. This is where hackers programme an ATM machine to release all its contents. But Kinoti said investigations have revealed some people from inside interfered with the CCTV cameras to conceal evidence before the incident happened.
