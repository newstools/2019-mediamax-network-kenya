AMOS ABUGA Kenya are saddled on top of the standings with 17 medals ahead of the penultimate day of the Africa Under-20 and 18 at the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Stadium, Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Of the medals from the two championships: five are gold, eight silver and four bronze. The 2018 World Under-20 1,500m champion, George Manang’oi, Mary Moraa, the 2017 World Under-18 400m silver medallist and Zena Jemutai are the latest gold medals winners for team Kenya. Moraa clocked 53.57 to win the women’s 400m title in the U20 category seeing off Sara Ehachimi from Morocco in 55.02, as Nigeria Glory Patrick Okon timed at 55.18 for bronze. Moraa has told Wikendi Sport she has plans of scaling up to 800m while aiming to run in the IAAF Diamond League series. “I am so happy for yet another victory, this is down to a lot sacrifices while in training, I could not have done it without the help of team Kenya and my coaches,” she said. “I have been planning to venture into 800m and maybe 1,500m afterwards. I have a time of 2:05.02 in 800m, I know it can get better with training,” added Moraa who has been training from Ngong’ area in Nairobi. Venturing into the two-lap race is also being motivated by the desire to get a manager in her upcoming career which ultimately will translate to monetary rewards should she do well in the races. “I will not be running for ever that is why I need to plan for my future, while sprints are fancy, there is nothing much to show for it from the Kenyan perspective,” added the 19-year-old. The runner had challenged the Kisii County Government to up their game and appreciate the achievements of athletes. “I will not leave the airport unless the county government sends officials to receive us, other counties are supporting their own, it about time ours (Kisii) did the same,” she concluded. For his part, team Kenya captain Manang’oi, who is also the 2017 World U18 1,500m champion, ensuring a Kenya 1-2 finish was special. “I have been training hard with Dickson Lesia, so I was not shocked for the results,” said the captain after a 1-2 in the men’s 1,500m U20 category.
