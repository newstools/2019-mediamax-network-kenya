Pascal Sala @salapascal The eldest son of former president Daniel arap Moi, Jonathan Moi, has died. Jonathan died on Friday evening at a Nakuru hospital. President Moi’s press secretary Lee Njiru confirmed the death on Saturday morning adding that the family will issue detailed statement on Sunday. Jonathan Moi was a renowned Safari Rally driver and participated in several competitions. His brother, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, in a statement described him as an amiable, social, down to earth and industrious man. “Jonathan will be remembered for his daring exploits in the racing tracks, in muddy and dusty tracks, during this time of Easter,” Senator Moi said. “We are distraught as family and we ask for your prayers and seek your understanding and indulgence to allow us mourn privately. We will continue to inform Kenyans on need basis and further arrangements,” he added. Jonathan chose to stay away from politics after vying for the Eldama Ravine parliamentary seat in 2002 which he lost.
