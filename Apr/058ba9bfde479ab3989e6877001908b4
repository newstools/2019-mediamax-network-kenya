Manufacturers of animal feeds have increased prices of fodders by more than Sh300 for a 50kg bag. This follows low supply of raw materials as the local market continues to grapple with low supply of maize, which is the principal component in animal feeds manufacturing. Association of Kenya Feed Manufacturers which has a membership of 90 milling firms, said lack of maize supply in the market is hurting feeds production  and eventually if no adequate supply is provided some might close shop. Manager of the association Humphrey Mbugua said a number of milling firms are operating below capacity due to reduced supply of maize. He said prices of animal feeds were adjusted recently following reduced supply of maize in the market. Mbugua said in phone interview yesterday that every year,  Kenya grapples with shortage of raw materials as nearly all locally produced maize is consumed, leading to a deficit which is met through imports. Increase in price of animal feeds is further expected to trigger high prices of products such as eggs, milk and meat. He said the association has in the last one week held meetings with the government on how to increase maize supply in the market to stabilise prices. “We are hopeful this week the government will release maize to the market,” Mbugua added. In 2017 when the country experienced severe drought leading to high price of raw material, 25 per cent of animal feed manufacturers close down.
