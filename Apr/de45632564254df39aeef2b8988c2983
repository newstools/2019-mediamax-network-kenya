Zadock Angira The Numerical Machining Complex bought two machines worth Sh38 million at an inflated cost of Sh121 million, investigations reveal. Detectives from the Economic and Commercial Crimes Unit at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations are also investigating a case in which a Chinese company was awarded a tender, and paid in full, but never delivered. In one of the cases investigated by the DCI, Greenberg Holdings Ltd was awarded the tender for supply and installation of a CNC Universal Turn Mill machine. The tender was advertised on January 30, 2015. A purchase order number dated March 20, 2015 shows that the machine was bought at a cost of Sh98,878,941 and not the normal price of Sh30 million. Crimes unit detectives have asked the NMC to furnish them with copies of the purchase order and payment voucher of the machine. The head of the ECCU directed the managing director of Numerical Machining Complex to furnish them with documents related to the fraud. “This office is investigating a case of stealing by servant of funds Contrary to Section 281 of the Penal Code. To enable us complete our investigations kindly furnish us with certified true copy of the following purchase orders,”reads part of the letter. The detectives also sought the payment vouchers for the purchase orders and other relevant documents which could assist them in investigations. In another suspected fraud under investigations, NMC is said to have bought a machine worth Sh8 million at an inflated cost of Sh23 million. NMC is an engineering firm established in Kenya in 1994 for the purpose of manufacturing motor vehicles, spare parts and steel production.
