Clement Kiplang’at comes from little-known Soliat Boys’ Secondary School in Kericho County. His recent achievements on the athletics field have put the school on the Kenyan map – for all good reasons. Last week, he tacked his biggest sporting prize so far after being declared the best athlete in the just-concluded Kenya Secondary Schools Athletics and Track events in Mombasa. He triumphed in two races and was second best in 200m after clocking 22:7 in a race won by Ronald Koech from Koiyet Secondary School in Bomet County who crossed the finish line at 22.4. Kiplang’at was victorious in the 110m Hurdles with a time of 14:7 and won the 4x100m Relay when he lifted his Rift Valley team to win in 43.6. Kiplang’at extended his prowess in the Long Jump but fell short of winning a medal managing a poor fifth position. “I accept the honour to be declared the best athlete for the year 2019. Budding athletes I am full of joy for this honour even though it came as a surprise because I didn’t expect it,” said Kiplang’at upon arrival in Kericho from the national games in Mombasa. He regrets for being disqualified in the 100m for a false start insisting he could have won the race which he had prepared well for. “I take athletics seriously, so to my education and I have therefore firmly focused my eyes on these. I am going to train even more seriously as I prepare for upcoming athletics meetings within and without,” said Kiplang’at, a Form Four student. The upcoming athlete says his role model is the Jamaican track star Usain Bolt. He reveals that he was inspired by Bolt to love athletics. “I am training hard now and I hope to match or break Bolt’s world record in the next few years,” says the budding athlete. Apart from being coached by Christopher Cheruiyot, a teacher at the school, he is also among upcoming athletes who train at Sigowet Athletics Training Camp, run by prominent athletics tactician Japheth Kemey.
