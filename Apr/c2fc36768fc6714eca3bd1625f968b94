Kericho county has launched Wezesha Jamii youth empowerment initiative aimed at connecting youths in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutions (Tvets) to opportunities by empowering them with practical skills for formal and self-employment. The programme, a partnership between the Council of Governors and Godrej Group of Companies, will be rolled out nationwide as part of the National government’s competence-based education for vocational training centres. Speaking during the launch of the programme at Chebigen Vocational Training centre on Thursday, Governor Paul Chepkwony commended Godrej for supporting efforts to expand and equip hairdressing and beauty programmes. “We are very excited about the partnership as it will fulfill our objective of empowering lives of the county youth,” he said. Godrej chief executive Garav Kaushal said the company recognised that vocational training enabled sustainable enterprise development in Kenya. “Through hairdressing and beauty therapy training, we hope that youth will be empowered to identify and seize emerging opportunities that can help Kenya sustain its productivity. They will also be provided with financial literacy, communication and business skills to enable them to be entrepreneurs,” he said. During the event, the governor handed over a Sh2.25 million cheque to the institution as tuition fees for students enrolled for hairdressing and beauty therapy courses. He also signed a memorandum of understanding for a five-year partnership with Godrej. The launch was attended by representatives from Nyamira, Homa Bay, Kilifi, Narok and Migori county governments. -KNA
