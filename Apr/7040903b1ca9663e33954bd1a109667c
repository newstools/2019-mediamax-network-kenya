As protests continue in Sudan, the United Kingdom, United States and Norway (known as The Troika) have urged the government to respond to the demonstrators’ demands in a “serious and credible” way. In a statement, the countries call for the government to release all political detainees and lift the state of emergency which was imposed by President Omar al-Bashir last month. The three countries promise to support and help resolve “some of the long-term economic challenges that Sudan faces” if the Sudanese authorities take the steps outlined in the statement. -BBC
