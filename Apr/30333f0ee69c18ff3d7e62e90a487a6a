The government plans to register 185,092 persons in Machakos in the ongoing National Integrated Identity Management System (Niims) registration drive. Machakos Assistant county commissioner George Kabwika said 39,672 people have been registered in the area since the launch of the exercise on April 2. He said the government’s target is to register at least 4,113 people daily before the exercise closes on May 18. “We have so far registered 39,672 people since we began the exercise on April 3, following the launch of the programme. We are doing well and believe we will attain our target by the close of the registration drive,” he said. Kwabika said National Government Administration Officers have been carrying out sensitisation forums to educate the public on the need to get a Huduma Namba. He said the government has 145 registration assistant officers in the area with 141 working in the sub-locations while the rest are based at Machakos Huduma Centre. The multi-billion biometric registration module aims at harmonising and standardising citizens’ personal data into a single number for effective service delivery.
