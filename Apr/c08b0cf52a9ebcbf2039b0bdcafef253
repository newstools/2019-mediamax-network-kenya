Peter Sagini The Kenya national team Harambee stars is reportedly not keen to play Nigeria and Tunisia for friendly matches ahead of the 2019 Africa cup of nations (AFCON). Harambee stars will be coming back to the confederation after 15 years, and are placed in group C with Algeria, Senegal and fellow East African team Tanzania. The team will be camping in France, Paris for a period of three weeks before going to Egypt for the AFCON finals. Football Kenya Federation President Nick Mwendwa has constantly claimed that they are working ceaseless to secure a high profile build-up games for the team, and there have been reports that fixtures against Nigeria and Tunisia have been sought. However, according to the source Harambee stars might turn down the offer to play the Super Eagles as part of the preparations for AFCON. “Playing away in Abuja or Tunis with the probability of a heavy defeat just before the tournament starts may not help the team’s confidence,” said the source. The source further adds, “Then the proposed dates for these matches are too close to the tournament and there is that possibility of getting injuries. You also have to factor in the weather.” Kenya could face Madagascar, Uganda or Ivory Coast in France, with coach Migne expected to name his 30-man training squad in the coming days.
