Stakeholders in the tourism sector have threatened to move to court to stop sand harvesting off Diani beach by the Kenya Ports Authority. They said the activities are causing massive destruction of coral, beach and marine life in Nyali, threatening the tourism industry. Sand harvested from Waa and Tiwi areas is being used for construction Kenya Ports Authority’s Phase 2 terminal. Stop degradation Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Coast branch executive officer Sam Ikwaye said they will take necessary measures to stop degradation of marine ecosystem. Kwale county government has also demanded that sand harvesting and dumping activities be immediately stopped. Land CEC Saumu Beja said the county had written to the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) and KPA to stop the “illegal activities to protect marine life”. Ikwaye said KPA is acting in total disregard of the law and has continued with the activities even as environmentalists and residents raise concerns. “If KPA does not listen to us, we will have no option but to move to court,” said Ikwaye. Earlier this month, KPA, through a public statement published in a local daily claimed it had engaged relevant stakeholders on the matter and agreed to proceed with sand harvesting amid public concerns of marine destruction. According to the statement, KPA claims a rapid assessment investigation on the impacts of sand harvesting on the coral reefs system was conducted on March 28.
