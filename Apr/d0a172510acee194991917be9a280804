Seth Onyango @SethManex President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga are scheduled to arrive in China today to negotiate a loan to finance the next phase of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). They will be seeking Sh368 billion to extend the SGR line from Naivasha to Kisumu. It is the first joint official foreign trip between the bitter political rivals-turned-close allies. Top on the agenda will be to strike a favourable loan repayment plan for the facility, with Kenya already owing China more than Sh477 billion. Last evening, Raila’s spokesman Denis Onyango said the ODM leader, who is also the African Union  High Representative for Infrastructure Development, will put a case for promotion of practical international cooperation in transport and communication projects.
