Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Kenya topped the medal standings as the 14th Africa U20 championships ended at the Félix Houphpuët-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire on Sunday. Kenya scooped 28 medals (13 gold, 10 silver and five bronze), with South Africa coming in second with 25. However, in the third Africa U18 championships, which were also being held concurrently in the west African nation, Kenya finished second with 17 medals (six gold, six silver, and five bronze) behind leaders South Africa who had 32 (18 gold, seven silver and as many bronze). After the conclusion of the five-day championships, Kenya amassed 45 medals (19 gold, 16 silver and 10 bronze) in both events. Samson Ndigiti, who won gold in the boys U20 category in the 10,000m walk, is not surprised with the results, having won bronze during the 2017 World U18 Championships held in Nairobi. The 19-year-old, who finished sixth during the World U20 Championships in Finland last year, is now pondering on whether to shift to 5,000m ahead of the September All Africa Games in Morocco. Ndigiti switching “At one point, I will have to make a decision and move to 5km, and maybe road races in the future. I do not see myself in the walk race forever,” added Ndigiti who has successfully run the 5,000m before. While he might not be eligible for the World U20 Championships in Nairobi next year, the Form Four student at Kiendege High School, Nyamira county, is targeting the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. “I have international experience and I want to prepare for the Olympics next year and then maybe after that I can concentrate on 5km and 10km,” he added. The trio of World U-20 5,000m champion Edward Zakayo, World U-18 2,000m steeplechase champion Leonard Bett and World U-20 5,000m champion Beatrice Chebet, all bagged gold in the just-concluded event. They had been given wild cards to the junior championships.
