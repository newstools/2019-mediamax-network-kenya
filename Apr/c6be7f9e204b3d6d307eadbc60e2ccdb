Amos Abuga Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka has promised to look for another team sponsor to support Sportpesa Premier League side AFC Leopards next season. Speaking on Monday when he hosted the entire team including team legends for lunch at his Karen residence, Lusaka who had also hosted the team for break fast last week, commended the team for turning the team’s fortune around after a poor start to the season. The Speaker gave Sh 500,000 to cater for the seven days the team will be camping in Kakamega before they host Nzoia FC on Wednesday and Mathare United on Sunday in back-to-back crucial league matches. He further gave Sh100,000 to the players, Sh100,000 to the legends and Sh 50,000 to the officials and technical bench members. “AFC Leopards has been and remains our greatest pride and a source of unity. It is humbling to share a meal with these great men who took the club to the peak. I will look around for another sponsor to plug the shortfall in the team’s official sponsorship,” Lusaka said. Leopards, one of the country’s oldest football clubs, has had a bad run due to financial constraints. This is despite the official sponsorship by SportPesa. The team management admitted that the monthly sponsorship fell short of the team’s monthly expenditures. Having turned the season around from relegation contenders, Ingwe currently stands at position 10 on the league table with 34 points.
