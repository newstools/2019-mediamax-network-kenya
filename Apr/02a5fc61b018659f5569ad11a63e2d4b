Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i has directed police officers in Kitui to enforce the charcoal production and sand harvesting ban issued by the county government to protect the environment. Speaking on Wednesday after touring the county to assess Huduma Namba uptake, the CS decried the upsurge of illegal sand harvesting and charcoal burning and called on all government agencies to curb the vice. “This ban stands to be enforced by the government until it is lifted by the county government. That is the law and anyone found culpable of the offence shall be charged,” he said. Governor Charity Ngilu, in a gazette notice dated January 16, 2018, banned the sale and transport of charcoal and sand in the county. County Environment executive John Makau said the county has developed an energy master plan tapping into the Last Mile power connectivity and renewable energy to stimulate rural economies.
