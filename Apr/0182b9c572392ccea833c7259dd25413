Amos Abuga @PeopleSport11 Former Kenyan international Paul Bitok is reportedly preparing to succeed long-serving Kenya Volleyball Federation president Waithaka Kioni who is in his final term. Bitok still has two months to go as Rwanda national team coach and is said to have declined a new contract, bringing to an end an extraordinary 10-year stint in the tiny landlocked African country. The 45-year-old has not revealed his next move yet but is believed to have an eye on the KVF top seat which Kioni, who is also the Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB) second vice president, has been occupying for 21 years. “As a former player and coach, the game’s stakeholders are in agreement as he understands the sport better and therefore has the passion to steer us forward,” said a member of the current regime who did not wish to be named. Kioni’s achievements Kioni is currently serving his final four-year term following the amendment of the constitution in 2014, establishing two-term limits to all elected officials. In April 2018, he defeated Martin Ochieng to retain his position. Kioni, who also doubles up as the second deputy vice president of the National Olympics Committee Kenya (NOCK), believes whoever comes in will find a house already in order. “I have always promised to remain faithful to the volleyball fraternity as I serve my final term because I want to leave behind a good legacy. I have no say on who comes after me, what matters is respecting the game,” said Kioni. He added: “I am happy we do not have wrangles as seen in other federations. That is one of the things I am proud of. At the team level, I am happy that it was during my tenure that the national team won a World Grand Prix gold in 2015.” “Olympics are also coming next year, I believe KVF will be in a position to send a team to Tokyo, Japan,” said Kioni.
