Yobesh Onwong’a @PeopleDailyKe Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki yesterday assured Cuban doctors working in Kitui county of their security. During a tour of Kitui County Referral Hospital on Wednesday, Kariuki, who was accompanied by Governor Charity Ngilu, said security at the facility and doctor’s quarters had been beefed up. A fortnight ago, two Cuban doctors, Landy Rodriguez and Herera Correa  were kidnapped by armed gunmen in Mandera. The two were ambushed while on their way to Mandera County Referral Hospital. An Administration Police officer was killed during the ambush. Two days later, Anti-Terrorism Police Unit arrested a driver, Isaack Ibren, suspected to have links with the abductors. Following the incident, Cuban doctors working in Lamu were evacuated. The doctors are part of a group of about 100 Cuban medics who came to Kenya last year to help boost health services.
