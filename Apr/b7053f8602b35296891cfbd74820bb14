Millam Murigi @millymur1 A real estate developer, Banda Homes, has handed over their first project, Oak Park estate to their owners.  Located at Kimunyu in Gatundu South, Kiambu county, the project consists of 77, three-bedroomed all en suite bungalows. Speaking during the handover ceremony recently, Banda Homes CEO Fabian Nzivo said the success of the one-year journey is a clear indication that off-plan housing model works contrary to social media reports that have been doing rounds, saying this model doesn’t work. “We thank God that this project is over now and we are handing it over to respective homeowners.  Though it was not an easy task, we thank God that it’s a success,” he added. Rose King’atua, one of the homeowners, said she decided to invest in the project in good faith even though at first she was hesitant.  After visiting the site a few months later to view construction work in progress, all her fears were dissipated. “Now I know that off-plan is true. It is time for women to wake up, be independent and become part of the building community,” she said. Briefing the home buyers and invited guests on the future plans of Banda Homes Developments and the company at large, Nzivo said:  “We will endeavour to deliver our projects within the agreed time. Affordable housing should no longer be a dream because this is an awakening reality”. In the next three months, the firm plans to finish their second project, Pinewood Estate, which consists of 96 houses. The third project, Marple Ridge Estate comprising 122 units will follow shortly after. On Tuesday, workers at Pinewood Estate site  barricaded Kenyatta Road in Gatundu claiming they had not been paid for weeks.
