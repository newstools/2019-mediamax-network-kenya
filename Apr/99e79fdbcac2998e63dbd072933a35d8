Tourism stakeholders in Malindi have protested frequent power outages and poor emergency response by Kenya Power (KP). The stakeholders claimed that for the last one year, they have incurred huge losses occasioned by power outages and destruction of properties through fire outbreaks. This emerged during a stakeholders meeting organised by KP in conjunction with Kenya Coast Tourism Association in Malindi aimed at addressing concerns raised by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Service delivery They claimed KP had failed in service delivery to its customers. Kenya Coast Tourism Association vice chairman Philemon Mwavala said unreliable power supply has forced hoteliers to invest huge amounts of money in installation of generators which has driven up the cost of doing business. Watamu Marine Association chairman Justin Kitsao said poor power connections have caused fire outbreaks that have razed down many local tourists facilities. Decrying poor security, Kuldip Safaris manager Said Hashim wondered why nearly three quarters of Malindi town is always in darkness. Customer care Kenya National Chamber of Commerce chairman Majid Swaleh said Malindi has suffered neglect by the power supply company. “KP offers 24-hour services to other major towns but in Malindi the service is not available. We have sent a complaint letter to their offices but it has not been responded to up to now,’’ he said. KP Coast regional manager Hicks Waswa said the company has begun engaging stakeholders to ensure their concerns are addressed.
