The first time I heard of Xian Restaurant was last year. My friends sent me alluring photos of the place complete with seating near the pool, and were wheedling me to go. Thing is, there was an aerobics challenge at around the same time and I was sure they were using the beautiful Chinese restaurant to lure me to go. I love food, and you can probably trap me with food, but two hours of aerobics just sort of balanced my crazy love for Chinese food. So, a few months later, after being left home alone, I set off for Xian. I had been told that the restaurant is big on portions; I was banking on eating supper and carrying leftovers for the following day lunch. The eatery is located at the Salonika Villas on Muthangari Road in Lavington. In the dusk light and the few globe lights around the pool, the restaurant looked stunning. Afraid of mosquitoes, I did not sit by the pool. I instead settled inside, where beautiful Chinese fans decorated the walls with scarlet curtains. I ordered chicken mushroom soup. It is prepared fresh, and as I waited for it, I was served crackers and carrots to munch on. My soup arrived hot and thick with lots of leek. I loved it and almost did not order anything as it was quite filling. I never back down from a good ‘let’s overeat why don’t we’ challenge. So, I ordered some chicken noodles and chicken Szechuan. The portions were larger than I had expected. I ended up eating only a bowl and carrying the rest home. But not before I had a glass of wine to celebrate that my bill was less than Sh2,000.
