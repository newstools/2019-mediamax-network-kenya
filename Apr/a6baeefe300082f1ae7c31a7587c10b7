Since they dropped their collabo recently, songstress Jovial and Arrow Bwoy have been pictured in different gigs and lately, the doe has been close to each other raising questions. After the release of Dekeza, grapevine had it that the two had different chemistry away from the booth. However, speaking to Spice, Jovial stated that the two were just friends and colleagues in the same industry and that people should not read too much into it. “I enjoyed working with him and he is great company too, away from that, we are keeping it professional, but as you know, people decided to come up with their own story,” she told PD Wikendi.
