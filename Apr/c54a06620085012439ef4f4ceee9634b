Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Detectives have widened the scope of investigations into the Barclays Bank of Kenya heist after it emerged that the financial institution had outsourced key operations from G4S, a private security firm. Preliminary investigations revealed that G4S enjoys unlimited access to ATM operations, including maintenance, physical manning, loading of cash and storage of liquid cash. “Barclays has outsourced most of its operations. Investigations are covering a wider scope of those suspected to be directly linked to the incidents, and in this case, those who control the systems and those operating on the periphery,” a senior officer privy to the investigations said. The ATMs have been examined to establish if any malware was run that made the cash loaded rejected and pushed to the reject bin where it was collected by the suspects. The machines, detectives said, are designed to reject any note that is mutilated,  wrinkled to dispense or if a multiple pick occurs. If tampered with, all the cash loaded can be rejected. Detectives from the Economic and Commercial Crimes Unit and Cyber Crime team spent the third day running analysing the bank’s and G4S systems to establish where the breach originated from. Also considered is the information retrieved from the ‘journal’ on transactions of the ‘reject’ operation, which should tell the time of the attacks. Effectively, as the custodian of the critical bank systems, the security firm has been profiled as a principal player in the heist, a case reminiscent to the Sh80 million theft at Cooperative Bank involving G4S guards. “The Barclays Bank money is stored in G4S stores. They only tell them which ATMs to load and what amount,” another source added. About Sh11 million were stolen from the bank’s ATMs at Mater Hospital, KNH, and Mutindwa Road. The amount of money stolen from the Kenya Cinema ATM is still unknown.
