The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of African Affairs has called on the Sudanese military to transfer power to a civilian administration as soon as possible. Makila James said addressing the issue of removing Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism could only begin once the military had handed over power. Ms James was speaking to the BBC after meeting the head of Sudan’s transitional military council, Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan. She described the general as very sincere and responsive to the people’s demand for a civilian government. -BBC Africa
