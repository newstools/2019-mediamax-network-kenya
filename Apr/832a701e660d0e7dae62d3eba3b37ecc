Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Despite a shaky start, President Kenyatta’s economic blueprint, the Big Four agenda, recorded significant growth in the four pillars — Universal Health Coverage, Manufacturing, Food Security and  Affordable Housing — according to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey 2019 released yesterday. In Universal Health Coverage, the national government increased budgetary allocation by 57.8 per cent from Sh61.8 billion in 2017/18 to Sh97.5 billion in 2018/19. Universal Health Development expenditure on health services is expected to grow by 77.7 per cent to Sh59.0 billion, accounting for 60.5 per cent of total expenditure in 2018/19. Recurrent expenditure is expected to grow by 34.5 per cent to Sh38.5 billion in 2018/19. County governments’ expenditure on health services is expected to grow by 28.7 per cent to Sh108.1 billion in 2018/19, out of which 77.5 per cent will be recurrent. Manufacturing Manufacturing grew by 4.2 per cent in 2018 compared to a revised growth of 0.5 per cent in 2017. The Survey shows that the sector’s output expanded by 5.1 per cent in 2018 from a contraction of 0.8 per cent in 2017. The growth was cridited to the increase in production of dairy products, tea, coffee and sugar owing to favourable weather conditions as well as the government push of the Big Four agenda in which manufacture is a key pillar. However,  a decline was recorded in sub-sectors involved in the manufacturing of plastic products, wood and other products of wood, and other non-metallic mineral products. Food Security Growth in the agriculture sector — on which the Food Security pillar rests — was recorded in crop and livestock production, mainly attributed to favourable rains in 2018. Maize production increased by 26.0 per cent from 35.4 million bags in 2017 to 44.6 million bags in 2018. Tea, coffee and sugarcane production increased by 12.1, seven and 10.4 per cent, respectively in 2018. The quantity of horticulture produce exported increased by 6.1 per cent while the volume of marketed milk increased by 18.4 per cent in 2018. Despite the affordable housing being one of the pillars of the Big Four agenda, construction  received meagre resources from Treasury. The government allocated the project Sh6 billion where Sh3 billion was for construction of affordable housing and the rest went to construction of police houses. Last year, the construction sector registered a slowed growth of 6.3 per cent compared to a revised growth of 8.5 per cent in 2017 according to the Economic Survey. The government intends to build 500,000 units estimated at a cost of Sh1.3 trillion come 2022. Attempts by the government to deduct 1.5 per cent from gross salary of all workers to finance the projects has been met with stiff resistance from workers and employers.
