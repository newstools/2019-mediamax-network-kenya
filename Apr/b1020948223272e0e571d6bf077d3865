Crowd favourites Shimanzi triumphed after putting up a skillful display to beat Maweni United from Malindi 2-1 with tournament’s Most Valuable Player Cedrick Asmani scoring their first goal after 35th minutes before Safari Juma made it 2-0 in the 45th minute. Dennis Okwaro scored the consolation for Maweni in the 74th minute. “We are happy to have won the title this time round after losing it last year. The boys have been training hard and we are not stopping as our eyes are set on the national finals,” said Shimanzi coach Christine Nanjala. Changamwe meanwhile, clinched top spot in the girls’ category after beating Malindi’s Solwogidi 1-0 thanks to Issa Hadwa’s last-minute header. Great motivation “It was a challenge under the floodlights because it was our first time to play under such conditions.  Our opponents were tough as well but we managed to get a goal. The win is a great motivation to the team and we are determined to excel in the national finals,” said Changamwe top scorer Joyce Hamisi. Besides securing a place in the national finals set for June, the winners also received a cash reward of Sh200,000 each.
