Kisumu All Stars have taken leadership of the National Super League after benefiting from three free points following a successful appeal of their match against Wazito FC last week. Wazito, who won the match 4-0, were found guilty of fielding midfielder Teddy Osok who was ineligible to play since he had accumulated five yellow cards, hence suspended. The decision sees All Stars take top spot in the 20-team table with 57 points same as second-placed Wazito who have an inferior goal difference. It was not all gloom for Wazito, however, as they also benefited from a boardroom decision after Football Kenya Federation Leagues and Competitions Committee awarded them three points for their abandoned match against Shabana on April 7, while slapping a Sh20,000 fine on Tore Bobe for what was termed as unsporting behaviour from their fans. All eyes will therefore be on the joint leaders this weekend as Wazito face Coast Stima at Camp Toyoyo today, while All Stars take on wounded Shabana at Gusii Stadium tomorrow. Shaban lost 2-0 to Bidco United on Wednesday and All Stars tactician Francis Oduor expects a reaction. “We have prepared well but we know our opponents have had not a rosy week and will be dangerous at their home turf,” said Oduor. Wazito meanwhile, will still miss talismen David Oswe and Dennis Gicheru through injury but should parade their new offensive recruits Musa Masika and Amos Asembeka behind Victor Ndinya, David Orem and Patrick Acquah against Stima, who are eighth on the log, and have lethal forward Abbas Muhiddin in their ranks. The other big fixture of the weekend will see title contenders Ushuru (56 points) and Nairobi Stima (55 points) lock horns tomorrow as they both seek to make ground.
