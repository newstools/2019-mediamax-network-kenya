Kiev, Monday Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelensky has scored a landslide victory in the country’s presidential election. With nearly all ballots counted in the run-off vote, Zelensky had taken more than 73 per cent with incumbent Petro Poroshenko trailing far behind on 24 per cent. “I will never let you down,” Zelensky told celebrating supporters. Zelensky, whose previous experience in the world of politics was playing the president on TV, trounced Poroshenko in a stinging rebuke to the establishment fuelled by anger over war and social injustice. Poroshenko, who admitted defeat after the first exit polls were published, has said he will not be leaving politics. Ukrainians looked to the future with hope and anxiety as Zelensky vowed to pursue the pro-European course set out by his predecessor. But Zelensky has also said he wants to improve ties with arch-enemy Russia. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday it was “too early to talk about President Putin congratulating Zelensky, or about the possibility of working together.” On the streets of Kiev, many praised the elections as a fair and peaceful transfer of power after popular uprisings of 2004 and 2014. Political novice US President Donald Trump and French leader Emmanuel Macron called the political novice to congratulate him, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged support. In a joint letter to Zelensky on Monday, EU Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker expressed admiration for Ukrainians’ “strong attachment to democracy and the rule of law.” –  Agencies
