Francis Muli Work related fatigue is one of the leading causes of depression. A 2017 report by the World Health Organisation said Kenya had the fourth highest number of depressed people in Africa. In 2016, of the more than 45 million Kenyans,  1.9 million had depression-related problems. In Nigeria more than seven million were affected, followed by Ethiopia with four million. The Democratic Republic of Congo had 2.8 million cases of reported depression. May being mental awareness month, here are ways you can avoid work-induced depression. 1. Take enough breaks Some people tend to forgo their off days, weekends and leave days. Working throughout clogs your brain and can lead to serious fatigue. Before you decide to forego your leave days, please remember that if you dropped dead today, the company will not collapse. Instead, after a few days, you will be replaced and unfortunately, soon enough, you will be forgotten. During you working hours, it is important to take breaks. Walk, stretch or talk to your colleagues. Sitting in one place all day cold kill your thinking capacity. After a long day in the office, make sure you have a shut eye for atleast eight hours. Lack of sleep can cause depression and could bring other health related complications. 2.Avoid enmity at work with colleagues Imagine spending more than eight hours with your enemy, doing the same task together. Always strive to make peace with everyone, otherwise stress and depression will be the order of the day. 3.Diet Eat food that gives you enough energy for work, and avoid foods that could harm your physical health. It is advisable that you eat more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and drinking six to eight glasses of water a day. 4.Exercise Health experts say that high-intensity exercise releases feel-good chemicals, known as endorphins, into the body. These are enough to drive depression away.
