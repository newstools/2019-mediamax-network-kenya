Supreme Court judge Njoki Ndung’u has differed with the Court of Appeal’s proposal to lower the age of consent from 18  to 16 years, terming it as ill-advised. She said it is unacceptable for a 16-year-old to be allowed to decide whether to engage in sex, adding that the proposal is outrageous and should not be given an ear by any “sober and sane” Kenyan. An amendment to the Sexual Offences Act presented to Parliament through the Statue Law (Miscellaneous Amendment Bill) 2016, wants the age for consensual sex lowered from 18 to 16 years. Court of Appeal judges Roselyn Nambuye, Daniel Musinga and Patrick Kiage recently said time was ripe for the country to consider changing the Sexual Offences Act, citing lengthy jail terms imposed on young men convicted of defilement. Ndung’u (pictured) spoke during the official launch of the first women-led Social Justice Centre in Mwandoni area, Kisauni sub-county, in Mombasa and was accompanied by UK ambassador to Kenya Nic Hailey, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti and Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji. In reference to increasing homicide cases, Ndung’u urged women not to wait until they are killed but should instead report to authorities to avert such crimes. “We urge women to speak up and report any cases of abuse,” she said.
