Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy The construction of the Sh347 million law courts complex in Nakuru county will be completed by August, Chief Justice David Maraga announced yesterday. The project, which had initially been projected to be completed in 2017, stalled for a year following changes in design. Speaking when he toured the three-storey ultramodern building, Maraga said the new courts will go a long way in improving administration of justice in the region. The complex is among Judiciary’s projects funded by the World Bank under the Judicial Performance Improvement Programme. “The new courts will improve service delivery in Nakuru,” aaid Maraga. The new building will house several courtrooms, including the Court of Appeal, judges and magistrates’ chambers, an underground holding cell and a library. The court rooms are bigger and will ease congestion experienced in the old courtrooms. Maraga said the Judiciary targets to have at least one High Court station in every county and Magistrate’s courts in every constituency. So far, there are 39 High Court stations in 38 counties.
