He was escorted by colleagues Patrick Makau (Mavoko) and Cecil Mbarire (Nominated).On the other hand, Ochieng of Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) was then sworn in next in the company of Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and Majority Whip Bernard Washiali (Mumias East). Ochieng’ defeated Chris Karan (ODM) after a successful petition he filed against the declaration of Karan as the winner in the August 2017 General Election. Welcomed back “Ochieng was one of the finest, decent legislators in the last Parliament and I am glad that he has made it back to serve the great people of Ugenya Constituency,” Leader of Majority Aden Duale said after the exercise. Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, however, urged “some Jubilee sympathisers taking credit of the victory to cool it down” because the two MPs are still Nasa members.
