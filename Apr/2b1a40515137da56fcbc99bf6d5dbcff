NAME: Ng’ombe AKA Mr Fresh ROUTE: Dandora #32 ATS Sacco Passengers: 33-seater Design and Art: Mwas Graffix Fabricated By: KCI Body Fabricators Initially, when most people heard Dandora affectionately named “hip hop city’, what came to mind was the high rate of crime triggered by a disproportionate number of school dropouts and the fact that the suburb serves as the principal dumping site for Nairobi. Currently, the tune has changed somewhat as this area, established in 1977 and partially financed by the world bank to offer good housing, is now rated amongst the top estates at unleashing leading Nganyas. On throwback, Dando was well known for having 14 seater javs, the likes of Kanye West and Betu before 33-seater javs replaced them. Earlier this month, Dandora ATS Sacco gave its best to the residents by unleashing the uniquely designed mathree “Ng’ombe” whose design is inspired by a freshian cow. In-car entertainment: On the main screens Ng’ombe is fitted with double 32” screens on the upper part and double 24” screens on the lower part. The jav has three 32” side screens and three 7” front screens. The sound was fitted by BIC Entertainment. Outstanding features:  Mr Fresh is undeniably one of the most eye-catching javs with its black and white colour scheme, the wheels fitted with bullets, which they refer as pembe [cattle horns], the interior, which the crew refer as Friesian belly is simply black themed and the novel design on the arrangement of main screens makes it stand out. Inspiration: Chatting with the pilot, Maino Muriuki, he gave us the inspiration behind the design. “The graffiti and the idea were inspired by the viral story about 27 dairy cattle, which were procured at Sh3.7 million each by the Kisumu county government. As outrageous as that was, we took the joke and run with it as the amount can buy a whole mathree,” he said.
