Zenit St Petersburg are aiming to strengthen their grip on the Russian Premier League title as the leaders prepare for Saturday’s trip to fellow championship chasers Krasnodar. Sergei Semak’s Zenit, who are seeking their first domestic title in four years, remain unbeaten in the league in 2019 and are six points clear of reigning champions Lokomotiv Moscow and third-placed Krasnodar with seven matches remaining. Last week table-toppers Zenit extended their lead after thrashing Anzhi Makhachkala 5-0 but Semak warned his side to not rest on their laurels ahead of Saturday’s clash. “Of course it increases fighting spirit and strength when you win so confidently,” Semak said. “But the six-point lead is not the guarantee of the ultimate success, there are still seven matches ahead. “No doubts that the clash at Krasnodar will be tough as both teams are in the hunt for the title. Krasnodar, who missed a chance to regain second place following last-week’s 1-1 draw with strugglers Dynamo Moscow, are keen to peg back the league leaders. “Last week the lads showed strong willpower … I’d like to see the same degree of motivation on Saturday,” said Krasnodar head coach Murad Musaev. “They currently have the most solid and consistent game in the Premier League.“We have no other choice but to fight our hardest if we want to stay in the title race.” Both sides will be without Pavel Mamaev and Alexander Kokorin, who are on trial for “hooliganism” and have been in Moscow’s Butyrka prison since October after attacking a TV presenter’s driver and two Russian trade ministry officials.  -AFP
