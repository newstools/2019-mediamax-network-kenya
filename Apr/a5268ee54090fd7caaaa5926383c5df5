Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi A set of identical twins from Kakamega county who hit the headlines last week after they met 19 years after birth, are undergoing counselling ahead of the outcome of DNA tests conducted on them. Sharon Mathias and Melon Lutenyo had the tests done on Friday. Psychologist Geoffrey Kibii said he had embarked on counselling for the girls and their parents to prepare them for the outcome of the tests. Accept outcome Speaking to People Daily in Eldoret yesterday, Kibii said the sessions are bearing fruit but  declined to disclose more information. “The twins and their parents have already undergone one counselling session to resolve their identity puzzle,” said Kibii, a lecturer at Moi University School of Medicine. The Lancet Group of Laboratories conducted the tests on the identical twins last Friday following intervention from Multiples to Multiples Society. Parents of the two girls demanded a DNA test to know whether they are related and were quick to add they would accept any outcome. Mathias, who has been raised by Angeline Omina, of Kangemi in Nairobi, is a spitting image of Melon. The two believe they are twins. Their extraordinary meeting excited residents of Furfural village in Likuyani constituency.
