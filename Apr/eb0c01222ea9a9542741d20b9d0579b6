Bernard Gitau and Henry Andanje @PeopleDailyKe A week after the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) reported that the March-April-May long rains may fail, many parts of the country started to receive rains from Monday. Yesterday, Nairobi, parts of Mt Kenya region, Nyanza and Western regions recorded heavy rains.  Nairobi’s central business district was flooded a few minutes after 2pm following a downpour that led to heavy traffic jams. Last week, acting KMD director Stella Aura said the dry spell would persist. “The forecast for the remainder of the season indicates that most of the country is expected to continue to be dry for the month of April,” she said. Flooded streets But in a statement yesterday, Aura said rain will be expected in  many parts of the country for the next six days. “Rainfall is expected over several parts of the country including Western, Lake Region, Central including Nairobi and South Western parts,” she said. Yesterday, Nairobi streets, roads and estates were flooded. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko last week launched drainage-unclogging exercise in anticipation of the rains. In Turkana, heavy rains paralysed transport on Kakuma-Lokichogio road. Flooding was also experienced in Teso South, Busia county where  residents were displaced by flood waters after Malakisi and Malaba rivers burst their banks. “We are worried that more destruction will happen if the rains will continue pounding,” said Moses Okware.
