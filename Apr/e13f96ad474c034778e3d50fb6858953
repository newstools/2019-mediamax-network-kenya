The UN refugee agency says it has evacuated nearly 180 migrants from a detention centre close to the area of fighting in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The agency said the operation was carried out amid crossfire. People relocated from the Abu Salim centre were among its most vulnerable detainees – including women and children. There’s grave concern for those still in the facility. The fighting is between forces loyal to renegade general Khalifa Haftar and militia groups loosely aligned with the UN-backed government in Tripoli. -BBC
