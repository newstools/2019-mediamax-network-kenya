Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Assets of eight companies that were used to guarantee government loans worth Sh147.7 billion risk being attached should the Executive fail to honour its obligations. Parliament warned that the country is at a risk of failing to refinance its debts as currently debt refinancing is at 50 per cent of the total projected revenues and thus this requires cautious domestic revenue management. According to Parliament, the rise in loans  is mainly associated with the repayment of syndicated loans, international bonds and 43 per cent of domestic debt. A report tabled before the Budget and Appropriations Committee (BAC) of the National Assembly by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), the eight companies include the financially troubled Kenya Airways Sh76.39 billion, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Sh33.7 billion, Kenya Power Sh14.01 billion and Kenya Electricity Generating Company (Ken-Gen) Sh10.86 billion. The others are Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) Sh6.95 billion, Kenya Railways (IDA concessionaire) Sh4.59 billion, Tana and Athi River Development Authority (TARDA) Sh542 million and East African Portland Cement Sh674 million. But despite the companies being used as guarantors the status of KBC, TARDA and Portland cement as at 2018 indicate that they are non-performing. BPO said the Sh147.7 billion is an increase from Sh133.79 billion in December 2017 due to increase in guarantees to the Kenya Ports Authority, KBC and a new guarantee provided to Kenya Power. Already the National Treasury in its annual public debt management report tabled in the National Assembly, has projected Kenya’s public debt to hit Sh5.6 trillion by June this year and about Sh7 trillion in 2022 when President Uhuru Kenyatta completes his second and final five-year term. The revelations came on the day BAC chaired by Kimani Ichung’wa discussed a proposed bill by Emgwen MP Alex Kosgey to cap public debt at Sh6 trillion as currently MPs have no role in controlling the government’s borrowing appetite.
