Irene Githinji @gitshee Devolution Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa yesterday urged counties to accept the available budgetary resources and use them prudently. Wamalwa acknowledged the harsh economic conditions Kenyans are going through saying the current drought has affected key sectors of the economy. Although he did not delve much into the matter, he described the situation as “just the reality of our times” and something the Government is aware of and has been discussed at different levels of leadership”.  However, he said a summit which brings together leadership of both National and County governments will be held soon to agree on the way forward. “This has been a tough year and there were expectations that the economy will grow but there have been challenges including drought which have affected the country.These are some of the things we should accept and use the available resources  well although meagre,” he said during the launch of  the Jukumu Langu civic education booklet, which seeks to address existing public participation gaps.. Council of Governors presented their recommendations to the Senate, saying the division of revenue between National and County governments should be equitable. COG further recommended that the base for 2019/20 financial year be Sh314 billion as legalised in the Division of Revenue Bill and not Sh305 billion as proposed by National Treasury.
