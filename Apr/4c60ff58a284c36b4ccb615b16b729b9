Robert Ochoro and Tom Rachuonyo @PeopleDailyKe The government has released Sh1.5 billion to improve infrastructure in schools to enhance learning, Education Cabinet secretary Prof George Magoha said yesterday. The CS assured stakeholders the funds would be allocated fairly and equitably, and promised to personally monitor the exercise to ensure the funds reach schools to help improve performance in national examinations. Speaking at Jogoo Primary School in Kisii after inspecting the ongoing training of teachers on Competence Based Curriculum (CBC), Magoha  urged Kenyans to support government policies and programmes to empower children. The CS, accompanied by area County Director of Education Pius Ng’oma, said he was impressed with the training and challenged Kenyans to embrace change for the country to progress. “Our teachers are good and need empowerment to empower our children. Some areas which require correction will be handled,” he said, adding that the training ends today. The CS, who attended lessons at the school, said he would visit several training centres to get first- hand information on it and lauded teachers for turning up for the initiative. Positive response At the same time, Magoha praised teachers for ignoring the Kenya National Union of Teachers calls to boycott the training. Speaking at one of the training centres in Nyanza at Kuja School for the Deaf, Magoha lauded teachers for responding positively to attend the training to equip them with skills required for roll- out of the new curriculum. “I assure participants of maximum protection as the government has intensified security to ensure those who want to disrupt the training are dealt with,” he said. He advised union officials to follow procedure to have thorny issues addressed amicably without confusing teachers committed to ensuring quality education among learners.
