ALFRED WANJOHI Zimbabwe boxer Monalisa Sibanda has vowed to demolish her Kenyan opponent Joyce Awino for the vacant Women’s International Boxing Organisation (WIBA) title. The bout, among four others will be staged on Saturday at the Nairobi Charter Hall. The born-again Monalisa who jetted in the country on Thursday said she has come for revenge having lost previously to Kenya’s Evelyn Odero last year. However she bounced back with a bang by beating both Florence Muthoni of Kenya and Irene Ssemakula of Uganda in Nairobi. “I am happy that boxing is picking up well in Kenya. I thank Caleb Kuya of Osaga Promotion for organising the event and also inviting me. I am ready, more than the word itself. I am expecting a good fight, nice and clean. But to me it is more like a delayed match. I want to show that I am a champion. I want to carry the belt back home. I won’t be in a rush for a knockout,” said Sibanda. Her Kenyan opponent Awino promised to give Sibanda a good run for her money in her first big match, billed to be the main attraction of the night. Uganda’s Opiyo Kenneth Kaunda also vowed to floor his Kenyan opponent Albert Kimaro in a Lightweight non-title 6 rounds contest. Saturday’s boxing fight is organised by Osaga Promotion and sponsored by Charlies Bistro, Chicken Inn and Marble Arch Hotel who are accommodating theZimbabwean. Entry fee, according to Kuya will be Sh1,000 (VIP) and Sh500 for the ring side. The event will ramble from 8pm to midnight as the venue will be hosting the Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) event earlier in the day.
