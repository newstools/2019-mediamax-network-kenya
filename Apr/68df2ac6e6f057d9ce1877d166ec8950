@snatchah_lion_official I’m a Mass Communication student at JKUAT. I started taking pictures just for fun at home as we had a small digital camera, the point and shoot types. My neighbor bought a DSLR camera and we decided to start a photography group in 2016 called Karliff Photography where we organized shoots and covered small events for people. The railway line is near my place and I always take a stroll there to take photos just for fun. Coincidentally on this day we saw the train which rarely comes by and I though the scene was perfect for a silhouette shot. CAMERA – NIKON D3100 F-STOP – f/7.1 Exposure time – 1/200sec Iso speed – ISO-100 Focal Length – 55mm Max Aperture – 4
