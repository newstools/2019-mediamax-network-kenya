Brian Musyoka Embu Level 5 Hospital will soon start offering cancer services to save patients from hassles of travelling to Nairobi for treatment. Health Executive Dr Jamlek Muturi said plans to operationise the cancer unit are at an advanced stage. Muturi said at a press conference in his office that the county government had organised a cancer marathon for May 12, with the aim of raising funds towards starting Oncology Unit at the hospital. He revealed that 10 clinicians have been trained adding that the county has received 10 oncology beds and hood machine for mixing drugs from the National government. “The purpose of the marathon is to raise funds to facilitate smooth running of the unit once opened. We want to save people, who have been travelling to Nairobi to seek cancer treatment,” said Muturi. He warned against smoking and excessive chewing of miraa which he said are leading causes of the disease in the area. The CEC also said excessive consumption of sugar, animal products and wheat are other predisposing factors to cancer. Dr Muturi said the county is registering about 200 new cases of cancer every year and urged members of public to turn out in large numbers to support the fundraiser and for free cancer screening during the marathon. “Cancer is treatable once detected early and this is to appeal to members of the public to go for checkup,” noted the CEC. The cancer marathon, which is aimed at raising funds for the Oncology Unit and sensitising the public on new trends on cancer has received overwhelming support from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), Embu County Assembly, Broadways Limited, several universities including Mount Kenya University, Embu Campus among other institutions.
