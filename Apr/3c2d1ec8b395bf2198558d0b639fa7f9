Panarottis, the much-loved pizza pasta restaurant, has opened its doors in Nairobi, Kenya. This investment of sh 60 million is the first one in East Africa and will be located at the Waterfront mall, Karen. Panarottis is a family-friendly Italian restaurant franchise. It’s the ideal setting to enjoy a delicious Italian-inspired meal and offers customers some great specials. “This store will specialize with Pizza and Pastas. However, coffee, ribs, and other delicacies are available,” said Mary Wacuka, Panarottis Kenya Director during the official launch of the restaurant. According to her Kenya is a mature market which is ready to grow both local and international brands especially because of the rising middle class and the projected population growth to 97 million by 2050. “Our vision is to open ten to fifteen restaurants within a ten -year period. With that kind of investment we are targeting to create about 1,500 jobs directly and another 15,000 jobs indirectly.” Speaking during the event The Waterfront Karen Director Dr. David Muguku said that he was positive that the restaurant would be successful. “We’re secure in our decision to work with Spur International. Their mission to provide outstanding food and excellent service synchronizes perfectly with our vision to raise the standards of the hospitality industry in our country and beyond. Panarottis joins other Chinese, Indian and continental restaurants to leave our shoppers spoilt for choice.” Setting up a shop in Nairobi is one of the many ways the Spur Corporation (which Panarottis is one of the brands) is trying to expand its brands. Currently, Spur Corporation has five restaurants in Nairobi and Naivasha under the Spur Steak Ranch brand.
