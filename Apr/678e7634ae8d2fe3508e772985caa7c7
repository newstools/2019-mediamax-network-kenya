Farmers in agriculture-rich area of Kinangop in Nyandarua county have a reason to smile following the construction of a potato processing plant. The multi-million Engineer Foods Processing plant located in Engineer town will address the perennial problem of low prices and lack of market for the popular produce. The plant that will be officially opened next week has the capacity to process one tonne of potatoes per hour and will address the issue of post-harvest losses and value addition. For years, farmers in the area have made losses due to lack of market after the Midland Food processing factory closed its doors due to wrangles over ownership. Plant manager Danson Ndegwa said farmers in Nyandarua had gone through untold suffering due to exploitation by brokers and lack of support from the national government. Addressing the press after visiting the plant, Ndegwa said unlike the brokers who bought potatoes in sacks, the plant would buy in kilogrammes. “For years farmers in Kinangop which produces lot potatoes have little to show for it and this plant will process their potatoes and offer them a market,” he said. He said the company had already contracted farmers in the region to supply them with potatoes, adding that they expect the produce to fetch good prices in the market.
