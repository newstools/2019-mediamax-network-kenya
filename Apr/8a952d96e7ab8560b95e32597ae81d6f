BBC Sport Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri has been charged with misconduct after he was sent to the stands at the end of Monday’s 2-2 draw with Burnley. Tensions boiled over at the end of the match at Stamford Bridge. David Luiz and Ashley Barnes were involved in an altercation on the pitch and a scuffle took place near the tunnel entrance at the final whistle. Blues assistant coach Gianfranco Zola said Burnley’s backroom staff “offended” Sarri. “I think there will be a follow-up on that. Maurizio felt very unhappy,” Zola said after the match. “We understand it’s a football game. You say words because of the adrenaline, but he wasn’t particularly happy.” Sarri did not take part in the post-match media conference and Zola said Chelsea were unhappy with Burnley’s time-wasting during the game. The Italian, 60, has until 18:00 BST on Friday to respond to the Football Association charge.
