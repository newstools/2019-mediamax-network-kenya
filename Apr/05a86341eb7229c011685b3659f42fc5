Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Former National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri will now spend one more week in custody awaiting ruling on bail review application on May 2. Swazuri filed the application on Wednesday before Justice Mumbi Ngugi seeking review  of terms issued on Tuesday in the Sh109.7 million-land compensation fraud case. He had been granted Sh12 million cash bail or alternative bond of Sh30 million by the anti-corruption court chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi. Director of Public Prosecutions, through prosecution counsel, Vincent Monda opposed the bail review application, saying it is misplaced and has no refuge in the law cited in the application. Contravention of law “The application for revision by Swazuri is wrong in law as it has been prematurely filed. The chief magistrate exercised judicial discretion fairly, justly, objectively and legally in the face of the objection for bail raised by DPP,” he told Justice Ngugi. In his application, Swazuri claims that bond and bail terms imposed on him by the anti-corruption court are unreasonably high and unjust. “The bail terms are unjust, exorbitant and in contravention of Article 49 of the Constitution,” he said in the application. Swazuri alongside his fellow former commissioner Emma Njogu, former NLC chief executive officer Tom Aziz Chavangi, Salome Munubi (director valuation and taxation) Francis Mugo, (director of finance and administration) and lawyer Catherine Wanjiru Chege were also released on a Sh12 million cash bail. Those charged with less that Sh50 million fraud were released on Sh6 million cash bail, while those charged with less than Sh15 million were released on Sh3 million cash bail. The rest, who faced one count, were released on a Sh1.5 million cash bail.
