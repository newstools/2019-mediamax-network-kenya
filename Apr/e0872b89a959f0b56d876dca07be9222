Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Institute of Certified Public Accountant of Kenya (ICPAK) has is cracking the whip on individuals who practice illegally contrary to Section 18 of the Accounting Act. This is the first time ICPAK is weeding quacks practising in the industry without any valid license. In the past, ICPAK has been using its internal mechanism to tackle the matter without involving the public. The move comes at a time when many professional bodies in Kenya are castigating their members and quacks in their respective industries of involving themselves in professional misconduct, including corruption – which lead to loss of public funds. ICPAK, chief manager professional services Nebart Avutswa said they raided one office and arrested one person by the name Ali Zet, who has been practising as an accountant in Kilimani area, Nairobi. He said Zet will be arraigned in court soon.  “ICPAK will ensure that the matter is followed to its conclusion,” he said.  Avutswa said about 50 individuals are practising illegally and they will ensure that they are arrested and charged in court. Avutswa was accompanied by head of legal services Harriette Chiggai and a contingent of police officers from Kenya Police Service. Section 18 of the Accountant Act subsection One stipulates that no person shall practice as an accountant unless he or she is a holder of practising certificate and a license to practice that are in force.
