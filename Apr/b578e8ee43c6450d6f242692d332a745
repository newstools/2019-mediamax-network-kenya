Homicide detectives have finalised investigations into the murder case against lawyer Assa Nyakundi Kibagendi. The new investigating officer Sergeant Oliver Mabuone, who has taken over from Constable Godfrey Munene yesterday presented Nyakundi at Makadara Law Courts, Nairobi, and requested for one more day to enable him visit the scene of crime. The officer also told the court that the suspect might face the less severe charge of manslaughter. Nyakundi’s defence team of Ken Nyaundi, Cliff Ombeta, Sam Nyaberi, Ken Bosire and Charles Nyakwana applied for anticipatory bail saying there were no compelling reason to deny him one. Makadara Chief Magistrate Heston Nyaga, however, said it was premature to apply for anticipatory bail adding that it did not matter that Nyakundi was an officer of the court since all people were equal before the law. He said the matter had generated great public interest and allowed police to detain the suspect for one more day at the Muthaiga Police Station saying the application by the investigations officer was reasonable. He further directed that the suspect  should cooperate with the police, and allowed the defence team to accompany Nyakundi and the detectives during the reconstruction of the crime scene today. He also allowed police to take Nyakundi’s fingerprints before presenting him in court. Nyakundi’s personal doctor Dr Paul Ngugi recommended intensive insulin treatment for blood pressure, saying that he was also undergoing depression.
