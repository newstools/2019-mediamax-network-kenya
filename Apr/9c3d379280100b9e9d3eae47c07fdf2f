Three people, including a student, died on the spot after a trailer lost control and rammed into a personal car killing the driver and a lady occupant. The student, who was walking home with her cousins from a flower garden beside the road, was ran over by the trailer as she tried to escape from the accident scene. The incident occurred where former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru lost his life last year. The trailer was coming from Kenol towards Nairobi when it lost control and crossed over to the wrong lane.  It rammed into the personal car before veering off the road and falling into a ditch. Kabati and Nguthuru residents protested the construction of a mortuary by a senior Murang’a politician at the scene, saying it was a bad omen according to Kikuyu tradition. They claimed since the construction of the mortuary, which is just a few metres from the scene, more than 10 people have lost their lives on the spot and want the politician to demolish it or convert it into a hotel. Several other people were seriously injured in the accident and were taken to Thika Level 5 Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. The bodies were taken to Thika General Kago Mortuary.
