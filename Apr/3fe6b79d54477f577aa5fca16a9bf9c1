EMMANUEL MASINDE Eldoret City Marathon champion Elkana Kibet will be defending his title Sunday as registration of the marathon ended on Friday. Speaking to Wikendi Sport two- time Kisumu International marathon champion Kibet says it will be difficult to defend the title in Eldoret because it will be highly competitive. “I am coming to Eldoret to try luck and defend my title as you know very well it will be very competitive to run in Eldoret City marathon because every athlete has prepared very well for the race.” Kigali International Marathon champion says he is not sure of his performance since he has been nursing an arm string injury and tendon. “I had an injury that is why am not sure if I will perform to my best like last year but I would be happy if I retain my title which I know it will be very difficult to do,” said Kibet, who trains in Trans Nzoia County under Volare Management. Eldoret City Marathon Race director Moses Tanui has revealed that they are on negotiation to partner with Boston Marathon as they will be sending their representative to Eldoret during the race to go and observe. “Negotiation are under way to make Eldoret city marathon to be a sister marathon to that of Boston but still we are in negotiations and also we expect a representative yet to be confirmed,” said former Boston champion.
