Members of the National Assembly will have the final say over the fate of a 419-acre piece of land that is at the centre of a dispute by five groups in Kiambu county. The decision was reached after the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of Land and the National Land Commission (NLC) failed to give a way forward regarding the piece of land that has been in dispute for the last 25 years. Departmental committee on lands chaired by Kitui Central MP Rachel Nyamai (pictured) yesterday said that they would retreat to write their report as to whether the title deeds held by Kamiti-Anmer Development Association were valid or not. The five groups claiming the ownership of the land include, Kamiti Forest Squatters Association, Muungano wa Kamiti Group and Kamiti Anmer Development Welfare Group, Kenya Forest Service and Kamiti Development Association. Nyamaiâ€™s decision came after Lands Cabinet secretary Faridah Karoney told the committee that title deeds currently being held are irregular until the government degazzetes the land.
