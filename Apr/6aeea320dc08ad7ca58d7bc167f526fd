Amos Abuga @PeopleSport11 An injury time goal from Rwandan striker Jacques Tuyisenge was all Gor Mahia needed to return to the top of the SportPesa Premier League table after edging out Bandari FC 1-0 at Moi Stadium, Kisumu yesterday. The defending champions, who have been very vocal in regards to the fixture pile-up, were destined for their third consecutive draw in five days before Tuyisenge came to their rescue, just as he has done crucially before. The hard-earned victory takes the holders to 49 points from 22 matches, one ahead of Sofapaka who have played three games more. Meanwhile, four matches are lined up this afternoon with the clash between Kariobangi Sharks and a revived AFC Leopards at Kasarani Stadium the highlight fixture. It will be a battle of two sides that started the season in contrasting styles, Sharks off the blocks first while Ingwe spent most of their early days loitering in the dreaded relegation zone. Ahead of their return leg fixture, Leopards, under the tutelage of Rwandan Andre Casa Mbungo, will face the encounter from a superior point, having  gone unbeaten in their last six league matches. Their last defeat was 1-0 reverse to Sofapaka over a month ago. In between, there have been three wins and as many draws, propelling them to 10th place on the table with 30 points, two behind Sharks who have not recorded a victory in their last six games. Elsewhere, eighth-placed Ulinzi Stars, fresh from forcing a 1-1 draw with Gor, will host relegation contenders Vihiga United at Afraha Stadium and  victory for the soldiers will take them to within two points off sixth-placed Tusker, who have 38 points, piling more misery on their opponents who are 16th on the 20-team log with 21 points, one ahead 17th placed Zoo FC and six adrift of basement side Mt Kenya United. The other league matches will see KCB take on Chemelil Sugar at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos as Nzoia United face Western Stima at Bungoma’s Sudi Stadium.
