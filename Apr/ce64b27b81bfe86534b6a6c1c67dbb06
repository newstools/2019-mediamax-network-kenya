Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Three political parties want the Constitution amended to create more positions to ensure representation of all regions and interests in the national government. The parties also propose that the number of legislators be reduced to check the ballooning wage bill. On corruption, they called for harsher penalties for people convicted of engaging in the vice. Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua’s Maendeleo Chap Chap party (MCC), Martha Karua’s Narc Kenya and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi’s Kanu said all regions should be represented in the next government. Prime minister The parties, which were presenting their views to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) taskforce yesterday, however, differed on  what system of government would help achieve their proposal. Mutua proposed that the government be expanded to have a president, who would be the head of state and government, a deputy president and prime minister, who would coordinate and supervise ministries. According to Mutua,the first runner-up in a presidential election should take the position of prime minister. Mutua also proposed that the Office of Leader of Official Opposition be facilitated by the State to effectively play the role of checking the government. Ceremonial Kanu, however, wants a parliamentary system with a ceremonial president and an executive prime minister. Secretary general Nick Salat said the prime minister should directly answer questions in Parliament. Karua proposed the reduction of the number of MPs to cut the wage bill. She also wants a proportional representation of all regions in State positions to ensure the government has the face of Kenya. The former Gichugu MP demanded the reconstitution of the BBI taskforce to make it inclusive, saying it was dominated by the ruling Jubilee and ODM. All the three parties called for electoral reforms that would guarantee credible elections.
