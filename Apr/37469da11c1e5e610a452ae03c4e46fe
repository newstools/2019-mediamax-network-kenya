Chief Justice David Maraga admitted yesterday that the high number of corruption cases was worrying and needed to be addressed urgently. Consequently, he has directed magistrates to move with speed and resolve the cases noting that Kenyans were getting impatient as cases drag in courts. Addressing the press, the CJ said Kenyans were impatient over the cases and needed action against those arrested. “I have directed the courts to move with speed and make sure that they dispense corruption cases as fast as possible,” he said. Maraga was, however, quick to note that the rule of law should be followed. “As the CJ, I cannot direct the magistrate on what to do and I urge Kenyans to be patient as our courts deal with the corruption cases,” he said. On the recent high bond terms issued by a lower court in Nairobi against Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal, Maraga said the action was within the law. He said the accused have the right to file appeals in the High Court which could review bail terms depending on the nature of the case. “A case is dealt with on its own merit and it is upon the respective magistrate or judge to set the bond terms depending on the magnitude of the case,” he said. On backlog of cases, Maraga said that five years ago, the cases stood at 240,000 but have since reduced to 27,000 with plans on to clear them soon.
