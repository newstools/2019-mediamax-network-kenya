A 51-year-old woman from Watamu has won an award for promoting conservation of the mangrove ecosystem in Mida creek, Kilifi county. Joyce Marimba, received the Woman of Excellence Award from the Kenya Association of Women in Tourism during a colourful ceremony held in Malindi. Traditionally, women were  not allowed to take part in mangrove planting but Marimba became the first woman to join the Mida Creek conservation group. “I never expected to win the award, I was shocked,” she said, adding that she joined the conservation group after a donor rejected its proposal because it was male-dominated. She said currently there are 15 women out of the 46 members, including youths, who are engaged in mangrove protection. Marimba said she would use the award to sensitise women and youths in the community on the importance of mangrove conservation. The ceremony brought together senior members of the association, including chairperson Jane Adam and Nana Gecaga (KICC chief executive). Kilifi Tourism executive Nahida Athman said the county government would allocate funds to support the mangrove conservation efforts. Mangroves protect vulnerable coastlines from wave action.
