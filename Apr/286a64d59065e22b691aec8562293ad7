Irene Githinji Teachers Service Commission chief executive officer Nancy Macharia has urged employees to obtain the e-passport to be able to travel outside the country. She said it would not be possible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate visa issuance for machine-readable passport holders. In September last year, the Head of Public Service, Joseph Kinyua, issued a directive requiring all public sector employees, who include teachers, to migrate from the current machine readable passports to the e-passport. “Due to the limited validity period of the machine readable passports and in line with the September 26, 2018 circular, travel clearance will not be issued to public officers, who do not hold e-passport,” she said. The machine readable passports will cease to be valid for international travel with effect from September 1, with travel clearance for public servants not being granted to those who will not have acquired the new e-passports. She said most countries require a passport to have at least six months validity before a visa or permit for travel is issued.
