Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i has today banned production and transportation of charcoal in Kitui county. “I have directed the county and regional security teams to mount operations to apprehend those involved in these activities,” Matiang’i said. Speaking while inspecting Kitui County Textile Centre (KICOTEC), Matiang’i promised to support Governor Charity Ngilu to weed out charcoal producers in the county. “I have had an opportunity to inspect KICOTEC factory and other projects which the Governor Ngilu is undertaking in this county. The National Government will continue supporting her in advancing the impressive work she is doing in line with the Big Four Agenda,” he said. The Sh20 million factory has employed over 600 workers. CS Matiang’i was accompanied by his health counterpart Sicily Kariuki.
