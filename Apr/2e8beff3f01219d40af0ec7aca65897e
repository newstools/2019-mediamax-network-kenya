Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Former University of Eldoret Deputy vice chancellor Ezekiel Kiprop and Finance Officer Hosea Sitienei have petitioned  the High Court to award them Sh100 million in damages for unfair sacking. Appearing before Justice Monica Mbaru, the two through their lawyer Kipkoech Ng’etich claimed the university was in breach of their constitutional rights, adding that it lacked mandate to dismiss them. Clients removal Kipkoech argued, there was no transparency, fairness and accountability in his clients removal from office, saying it was witch-hunt by some of the institution’s top management to paint them in bad light. “My clients were hounded out of office and their constitutional rights violated by the respondents. There was no transparency because the process was flawed,” said Kipkoech. In their submissions yesterday, the two are also seeking to be reinstated to the institution saying they had  five-year contract and  that the positions do not have a substantive replacement. Ruling is set for June 17.
