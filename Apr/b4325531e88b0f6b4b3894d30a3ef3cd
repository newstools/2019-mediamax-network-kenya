ADALLA ALLAN Why this car? Honestly, I saw it at a showroom at a dealer shop and instantly fell in love with it. I decided that I would have to get it. It took me one and a half years of hard work to save up and buy this car. Owning a Jaguar has been a lifelong dream of mine and I’m finally living it. Been on a road trip with the car? The longest drive was through the Southern bypass and then to Naivasha where I did my road test with a friend as a way of christening this ride on the roads. What does it do for you? Every day when I drive this car it gives me something new to remember. The speed, the cool sound system, the comfort and all the gadgets in this ride never fail to impress. In fact, It is the only convertible F- Type Jaguar in Kenya, the others are all hard top coupés. It is simply one of a kind. Any Drawbacks? Well, it is not about the car, but the roads in Kenya. The car is designed with low riding shocks and this makes it hard to drive it where there are potholes. That is the only challenge. With the car itself, I would say the manufacturer outdid themselves. DID YOU KNOW! Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), was bought by TATA, an Indian company in 2008 for Sh230 billion.
