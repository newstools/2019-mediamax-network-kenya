AFC Leopards chairman Dan Mule has said he will not be defending his position when the club holds its election in June. Mule who has been missing in action from the club affairs for the better part of this year, told People Sport that he wanted to concentrate on his private businesses that normally see him travel a lot around the continent. Despite being overlooked by the 16-man ‘Rescue Committee’ formed in early February, Mule says he is still in charge of the team, but will step down during the club’s Annual General Meeting next month after handing over all the club documents in his position. “I’m still the chairman of AFC Leopards, but I won’t be seeking re-election during the June polls. I was away on a business venture Zambia and South Africa for about three months and upon my return, I found the changes at the club which were done without my knowledge,” said Mule. He added: “We were not on the same page on some decisions they were making, but for the sake of the team, we just had to reach a middle ground and ensure that we don’t jeopardize the team’s effort to survive relegation.” The ‘Rescue Committee’ is led by Mombasa-based businessman Maurice Amahwa who lost to Mule during the last club elections held three years ago. The club’s former striker Dan Shikanda is the vice-chairman of the committee, with club secretary Oscar Igaida assuming a similar role. Before they took over the running of the club, the team had only won two of its 11 league matches in the season, a spate of results that had left them at an awkward position 17 out of 18 teams. They are currently occupying position 10 after going for unbeaten in eight matches. “I want to leave the club with my head high. There is no room for picking up a fight with the committee at the moment, because we have a common goal of seeing the team finish in top five and that would be a win-win achievement for everyone,” Mule said.
