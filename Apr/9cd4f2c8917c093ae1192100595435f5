Francis Muli The country is headed for hard economic times. Currently, we are experiencing a dry spell with the meteorological department pouring water on any hope that it will rain soon. According to the Met, this yearâ€™s drought could be the worst in 38 years. As a result of the prolonged drought, food prices will go up, putting further strain on our pockets. Already the prices have started soaring. For instance, a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour is now retailing at between Sh120 and Sh130, from between Sh75 and Sh85. Millers are mulling the idea of pushing the prices even higher. On Wednesday, the Kenyan shilling hit a three-month low, triggering fears of a rise in consumer inflation. Mid this month, the Energy regulatory Commission (ERC) raised the price of fuel by more than Sh5 for diesel and petrol and paraffin by more than Sh2. This is likely to affect the cost of goods as manufacturers push the additional cost to consumers. To manoeuver through such hard times, a lot of wit is required. Here are a few survival tips; 1. Save when times are good Spend where necessary, avoid luxury and save. Savings are meant to help you during tough times, or when you want to achieve a certain goal. Economists advise that your savings should be able to sail you through for six months, without relying on other forms of income. 2. Get Insurance When such times come, savings may not be able to handle some issues conclusively. This means that you should have some other source of income. Take a comprehensive cover for your family, to cushion you during hard economic times. Some may argue that insurance cover is luxury, but when hardships hit the cover will go a long way in sustaining you. 3. Have enough food in store You might have the money, but food might not be available in shops. When there is plenty, buy and store it for the future. Not only will this cushion you from scarcity but it will save you some coins when prices shoot up.
