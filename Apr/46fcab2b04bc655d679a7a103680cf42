The late Jonathan Toroitich Moi, who was the first born son of former president Daniel  Moi, will be laid to rest  tomorrow at his Kabimoi home after a mass service in Kabarak University.
The funeral committee chaired  by Kabaraka University vice-chancellor Prof. Henry Kiplagat said  preparations for the burial ceremony are complete even as Jonathan’s two other alleged children claimed to have been sidelined from their late father’s burial arrangements.
