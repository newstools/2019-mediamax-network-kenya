Kampala, Tuesday Ugandan police said today it had placed pop star MP Bobi Wine under “preventive arrest” as the fiery government critic warned his opposition movement would not be cowed into silence. Wine’s confinement under house arrest in Kampala came as the United States rebuked the government for its heavy-handed crackdown on the political opposition and urged it respect democratic rights. In recent days, police cancelled one of Wine’s concerts and fired tear gas at fans who rallied behind the colourful singer-turned-MP, who has emerged a potential challenger to veteran President Yoweri Museveni. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, tried to leave his home in the capital Tuesday only to come face-to-face with riot police encircling his leafy residence. Police spokesman Fred Enanga said Wine “planned to disrupt public order” and officers would stay put outside his home until further notice. – AFP
