Mercy Salisi and Alvin Mwangi Detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission on Friday arrested two Nairobi County Assembly members over Sh500, 000 bribery allegations. The two, Jared Okoth of Mathare North ward and David Mberia of Karen ward are currently being held at the EACC Police Station. They were arrested in South B while Woodley Ward Rep Abraham Mwangi managed to escape. However, EACC said they are still searching for him. Okoth and Mberia, who are members of the Culture and Social Services Committee, are accused of demanding Sh1 million bribe from the owner of the controversial Kiragu Waichahi School in Eastleigh South Ward, which has for some time been embroiled in ownership dispute. “The three are members of the Culture and Social Services Committee, who demanded a bribe of Sh1million to write a favourable report to the Assembly to counter the initial allegation they have made to the County Assembly that the school in Eastleigh was built on public land,” EACC posted on its Twitter page. The school is owned by a former Nairobi councillor Josephat Kiragu Waichahi. In 2015, the then Eastleigh South ward MCA Nelson Masiga Marakalu was charged with incitement to violence, malicious damage to property and theft. The MCA was accused of inciting residents to destroy Kiragu Waichahi School property on claims that it was built on a piece of land meant for building a public school.
