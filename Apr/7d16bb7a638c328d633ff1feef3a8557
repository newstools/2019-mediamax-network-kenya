The British government is set to release a Sh720 million grant to Kilifi County government for implementation of an urban development programme. The money is part of Sh7.2 billion the UK government will release to counties for urbanisation projects. On Tuesday, British High Commissioner to Kenya Nick Hailey signed a memorandum of understanding with Governor Amason Kingi  (pictured) to begin implementing the urbanisation programme, which will be implemented in five years. The funds are set to be used in projects identified, with Kilifi planning to spend the money on fisheries, agribusiness and blue economy. The grant is part of the sustainable urban economic development programme aimed at developing Kenya’s emerging municipalities into strategic green growth hubs. Kilifi was among 10 counties with the best proposals. Hailey said the programme will create jobs and improve the economy adding that unemployed youth will benefit from the projects. “The programme will bring real transformation. We now have a new approach for partnerships, it’s the people who come up with the ideas and they tell us what they need,’’ he said. Kingi said signing of the MoU marked the beginning of a long journey of transformation. He said Malindi has suffered because of poor planning as some parts of the resort town cannot be accessed. “We want to fix the drainage system and the shortage of housing as a way of upgrading our towns in a bid to attract investors in the long run,’’ he said. Kingi thanked the UK government for prioritising Malindi in the urbanisation programme and promised to ensure proper utilisation of the resources.
