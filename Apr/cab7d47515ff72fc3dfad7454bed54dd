Bernard Gitau and Henry Andanje @PeopleDailyKe Thousands of Kenyans were yesterday feeling the pinch of the heavy rains that pounded several parts of the country on Monday and Tuesday night leaving at least two people dead. Two women, one in Busia and another in Nairobi’s Kibera slums were swept away by flash floods. There were reported cases of roads being washed away, hundreds of families displaced and  property destroyed. Drainage blocked In Nairobi, most of the roads were submerged and with most drainage system blocked, flooding was inevitable. In Kibera, 23-year-old Vivian Awuor from Silanga  was swept away  by raging waters and her body found at Nairobi Dam  while two of her children are missing. In Teso North and South, the banks of rivers  Malakisi and Malaba were left flooded  wrecking havoc in the lowland areas of Akiriamasit (Teso North) and Akiriamas (Teso South) on Monday night and living one woman, Christine Akumu Ekol, missing. Teso North legislator Oku Kaunya who regretted the loss said such calamities can only be avoided by residents moving to higher grounds. In Turkana, transport along Kakuma-Lokichogio road was paralysed following downpour.
