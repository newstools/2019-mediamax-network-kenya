Here’s the thing, we are not against getting hitched. If anything, that’s what we want; happily-ever-afters for everyone. I am of the school of thought that proposals should be small and intimate, with those that really matter around, as opposed to what we have now made them. Last week, in one of my WhatsApp groups, our friend told us he had a client brief for an engagement event and needed to bounce off ideas. Of course we were teeming with those, beginning with suggestion of a fancy hotel in the outskirts of Nairobi. That was honestly not a difficult part; the part I could not quite grasp was his specification to have an elaborate and dramatic proposal. Like he wanted the drama in full gear! One of our friends suggested he be arrested by the security guards for wanting to check out with toiletries from the facility. I guess that’s what he went with, but I still did not see the essence of such. Or does the drama influence the sort of decision that will be made? I am convinced men too are watching soap operas. Why go to such extent? Remember the Korean guy who bought iPhones and popped the question in a mall and still got rejected? Remember how This Is Ess and her now ex-husband broke the Internet after their pomp proposal? I mean, who raised the bar so high? You are giving single people a hard time and by the way, such extravagant proposals only raise the bar as far as your nuptials are concerned. So, no, you do not need to even have a video on your social media timelines to let us in on how it went down. A picture(s) will suffice. If your pockets are deep enough, go all out for the fancy proposal you always wanted, but do not water down the main event; the wedding and consequent marriage. Leave the theatrics aside though, and plan something special with only those that really matter to both of you; she’ll say yes if she wants to. You cannot influence her decision.
