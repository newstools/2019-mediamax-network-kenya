Mutwiri Muriithi @mutwirimuriithi The manufacturing sector recorded growth as real value added increased by 4.2 per cent in 2018 compared to a revised growth of 0.5 per cent in 2017. Economic Survey 2019 released yesterday by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics  says the sector’s volume of output expanded by 5.1 per cent in 2018 from a contraction of 0.8 per cent in 2017. The growth was attributed to the increase in production of dairy products, tea, coffee and sugar cane owing to favourable weather conditions and government’s push  for the Big Four agenda in which manufacturing is a key pillar. However, declines in production were recorded in the plastics, wood, and other non-metallic mineral products sub-sectors. Notably, the value of credit advanced to the manufacturing sector by commercial banks and other industrial financial institutions rose by 6.5 per cent from Sh315.3 billion in 2017 to Sh335.7 billion in 2018. Consequently, industrial financial institutions jointly recorded increased values of credit advanced at Sh1.3 billion in 2018. However, the number of projects approved by industrial financial institutions decreased from 293 in 2017 to 240 in 2018 partly due to reduction in the number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) financed by Kenya Industrial Estates. Kenya Industrial Estates also continued to play its role of promoting SMEs by financing development activities.
