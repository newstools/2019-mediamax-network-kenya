Dar es Salaam, Tuesday Tanzania has denied blocking the publication of a critical International Monetary Fund  (IMF) report that accuses the government of President John Magufuli of undermining economic growth with “unpredictable and interventionist” policies. In the leaked report, seen by Reuters last week and which the IMF said was not made public after Tanzanian authorities did not consent to its publication, the Fund said a weak business environment and the implementation of projects that may not have high rates of return were likely to constrain annual GDP growth. “The government is still holding consultations with the IMF. We have not blocked the report in any way whatsoever,” Tanzania’s finance and planning minister, Philip Mpango, told Parliament. “They should not rush this debate, we are still consulting with the IMF on this report.” The IMF in Washington said consultations with the government had been taking place, and that it was up to the government to consent to the publication of the report. The IMF does not comment on the contents of leaked reports, it added. In a previous statement, the IMF said its staff report was part of its “mandate to exercise surveillance over the economic, financial and exchange rate policies of its members …” Mpango said its ongoing talks with the IMF were aimed at incorporating Tanzania’s views into the final report before its official publication. – REUTERS
