AMOS ABUGA Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League champions Butali Sugar Warriors take on their predecessors Kenya Police at the City Park Stadium on Saturday evening under floodlights. The champions carry an advantage to the creme encounter of the weekend with three points already having won their first match of the season last month. Police on the other hand have a single point by virtue of sharing the spoils in their only match so far, with Nairobi Simba in March as well. Victory will be crucial for Butali Sugar, who are chasing their fifth title, keeper Lynus Sang is optimistic the champions will prevail from the encounter. “This is the biggest match of the league, whoever takes it will have a huge advantage vis-a-vis title aspirations. I think we are ready to stamp our authority as the champions,” said Sang. In the women’s premier league, record winners Telkom will be up against Strathmore University’s Scorpions. The match set for Sunday at the City Park Stadium will be equally huge not only for the two sides but also determining the shape the women’s league takes. The first leg that will end on August 11 has already been interrupted on March 23-24 for national teams trainings. The other interruptions are expected on April 27-28 and May 25-26. Fixtures secretary Moses Majiwa further says there will not be league matches on June 1-2 to pave way for Mombasa Hockey tournament.
