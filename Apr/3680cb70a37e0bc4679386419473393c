Amos Abuga Gor Mahia extended their lead at the top of the standings to nine points after claiming a 2-1 win over a resilient Ulinzi Stars in a SportPesa Premier League tie at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru on Monday. Ugandan striker Erisa Ssekisambu had Gor in the lead as early as the first minute after heading home a Francis Mustafa cross and the lead would stand until the 76th minute when Ulinzi’s top scorer Enosh Ochieng continued his impeccable form in front of goal by scoring the equaliser. With the game headed for the draw, a swift counter attack saw substitute Samuel Onyango net the winner with four minutes left. Gor now have 58 points and with a game in hand over second-placed Sofapaka who have accumulated 49 while Ulinzi remain in eighth place with 36. Heavy rains before kickoff had made the pitch soggy and a tad slippery but the visitors had no issue in exerting their presence immediately as Ssekisambu, accorded a rare start, netted one of the season’s fastest goals with just seconds after kickoff. A cross from the right from Burundian winger Mustafa was met by a diving header by Ssekisambu for the opening goal.
