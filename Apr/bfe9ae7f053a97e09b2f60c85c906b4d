Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Government-owned dairy processor New Co-operative Creameries Ltd (New KCC) has been hit by claims of internal fraud involving supply companies linked to senior officials within the institution. According to a petition, controversial payments amounting to Sh6 million were paid to a single company in one month in 2018 reflecting duplicated figures but bearing different invoice numbers. On August 17, 2018, Packright Solutions received unexplained five different payments in a single day while additional payments were made at three intervals within 21 days. Interestingly, two listed company directors reportedly are said to have blood relations with at least two senior managers resigned from the company after the payments were flagged. According to records from the Registrar of Companies, Caroline Kamene Mutuku and Namu Meegan Njiru resigned as directors of Packright Solutions on December 31, 2018. Hellen Ndupoi Sirote was appointed the new director the same day. New KCC managing director Nixon Sigey remained tight-lipped over the matter. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives want to establish the managers fronting companies through proxies in contravention of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act due to conflict of interest.
