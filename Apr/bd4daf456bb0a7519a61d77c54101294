Wazito are top of the National Super League table but are not sitting pretty following a controversial win over fourth-placed Kisumu Allstars last weekend. On a weekend where 21 goals were scored, Wazito were the biggest winners, their four goals without reply taking them top of the 20-team log with 58 points but the result made news for the wrong reasons. This is after Allstars lodged a complaint to Football Kenya Federation alleging that Wazito fielded midfielder Teddy Osok, who was among the scorers, yet he was ineligible to play as he had accumulated ‘five yellow cards’. Sources have intimated to People Sport that Allstars, who are fourth on the table with 54 points, have sought redress with the FKF Competitions Committee which is expected to provide a comprehensive verdict and if found culpable, Wazito could be docked points. Allstars have cited two separate incidents where they were docked points for fielding an ineligible player last year same as Green Commandos who also received a similar punishment. Meanwhile, the chase for the title is getting more complicated after Ushuru and Nairobi Stima dropped points once again. The two are separated by a single point, but even with 10 rounds to go, they are showing the inconsistencies that saw promotion elude them last season. Ushuru, on 56 points, are second on the log after drawing 1-1 away to Eldoret Youth while Stima, under George Owoko, have for the third consecutive time failed to get full points after a 1-1 result against ninth-placed Administration Police. The indifferent un from the aforementioned seems to be benefiting Kenya Police as they have been closing in and are now fifth with 52 points, six behind the leaders.  The law enforcers beat basement side Kangemi Allstars 1-0 to inch closer to the leading pack.
