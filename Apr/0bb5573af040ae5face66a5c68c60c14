A row is brewing between Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and his deputy James Nyoro over the running of the county. Nyoro yesterday claimed the county has no hope of attaining tangible development and accused Waititu of chest thumping, high-handedness and exclusion. Speaking at Karanjee village in Limuru, Nyoro said it was unfortunate to see his boss running the county like a personal project. “There is not a single sign that we are headed anywhere in matters development,” he said, adding that the recent halting of the implementation of the county’s Sh16.5 billion supplementary budget worsened the county’s development woes. Waititu, however, dismissed Nyoro as a “cry child, who is ignorant of the Constitution”.
