Uganda’s Supreme Court has upheld the removal of 75 year age limit on running as president. This means that 74-year-old President Yoweri Museveni can seek re-election in 2021. Four judges voted in favour of upholding the constitutional court ruling on the amendment of the constitution while three voted against. A two-term limit was scrapped in 2005 to allow him to stand for office again. He went on to win a fifth term in the 2016 elections. Critics say this latest move opens up the possibility of a life presidency for Mr Museveni who has been in power for over three decades. -BBC Africa live reporting
