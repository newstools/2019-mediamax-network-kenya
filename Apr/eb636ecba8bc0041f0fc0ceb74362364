The office of Directorate of Criminal Investigations is investigating the loss of billions of shillings belonging to the South Nyanza Sugar Company (Sony). Sony sugar suspended acting managing director Bernard Otieno, while confirming that the investigations are on- going, said that the company had contracted private investigators to profile several cases indicting lawyers. Speaking to Business Hub, he said that the financial woes bedevelling Sony have been attributed to fraud by a cartel of unscrupulous lawyers. “Previously, only three law firms represented cane farmers compared to 51 today,” he said. According to a report by Advanced Forensics Ltd, a company of private investigators, lawyers have turned the facility into a cash cow. “When I assumed office, we set up a task force which unravelled serious financial rip-offs where lawyers purporting to represent farmers fleeced the company billions of shillings,” he said. Advanced Forensics Ltd established that a cartel of lawyers had made millions of shillings by forging documents and obtaining cash through false pretence. Speaking in his Kiambu office Kimani Njuki, the company boss,  displayed some of the death certificates allegedly forged by the fraudsters. One such document indicates that one Elijah Mberesio Onyambu died in 2013 only for him to “resurrect” in 2016 and demand payment for his sugarcane delivered to the company.
