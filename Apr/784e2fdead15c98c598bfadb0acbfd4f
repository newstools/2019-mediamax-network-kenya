Seth Onyango @SethManex Governors from counties worst hit by the prevailing dry spell have appealed for more emergency funds from the National government. Last month, the government released Sh2 billion for famine relief following reports that some people had died of  hunger. Mitigation Yesterday, the Council of Governors (CoG) held a meeting to discuss mitigation efforts for the effects of the drought. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi expressed concern that the situation may get out of hand and asked the government to increase emergency funds. He said Laikipia had allocated Sh50 million towards drought mitigation efforts and called on the national government to give the county Sh150 million more. Failed rains “We call on the national government to expedite the resource disbursement to effectively manage this issue since it will be long before the rains come,” said Muriithi. The Kenya Meteorological Department on Tuesday warned that no rains are expected any time soon. Acting Deputy Director Bernard Chanzu said the March-April-May long rains had failed.
