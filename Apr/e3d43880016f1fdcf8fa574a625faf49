Paul Muhoho and Zaddock Angira @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi lawyer Assa Nyakundi, who is suspected of killing his son Joseph Nyakundi last month will now take plea on May 7. Investigating officer Godfery Munene told Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji that the lawyer is still recuperating at the Nairobi Hospital under police guard, after suffering from high blood pressure, and is unable to plead to criminal charges. Lawyer Sam Nyaberi undertook to escort Nyakundi to court on May 7 for a formal mention, with the necessary reports to enable court to ascertain whether he was mentally fit to stand trial. Munene said investigations were not complete because the suspect was required to help detectives unravel key aspects of the March 17 shooting. Nyakundi has already recorded a statement. Kithinji expressed concern over the slow pace of the investigations and said the shooting was a matter of public interest. Police have expressed apprehension over Nyakundi’s release since his family members, including house helps, are potential witnesses. A report based on the ballistic examination and autopsy findings has rebutted the lawyer’s explanation of what transpired. On April 3, Kithinji had  directed that Nyakundi be charged with murder immediately he was discharged from hospital.
