Alvin Kariuki Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero was on Friday arrested by Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission (EACC) detectives over alleged irregular payment of Sh68 million to a law firm during his tenure. Kidero, who was arrested alongside former Nairobi Chief of Staff George Wainana and other county officials were taken to Integrity House where they were grilled for several hours. Kidero was booked at Kilimani Police Station. In a statement sent to newsrooms, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said he has approved the arrest and prosecution of 17 officials, who are said to be behind the payment of the money. On its part, EACC said it had initially submitted a duplicate of inquiry to the DPP last year but there were gaps that required more investigations before drafting charges. “The Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission (EACC) initially submitted the duplicate enquiry file to this office on December 11, 2018 and upon perusal and consideration of the evidence therein, a number of gaps were identified that required to be covered by way of further investigations before charges could be filed in court,”the statement read in part. Others arrested alongside Kidero are former Director of Legal Affairs Aduma Joshua Owuor,  Councillor Paul Mutunga Mutungi and former Mayor Joseph Ndirangu Kariuki. In the list also is former acting Director of Internal Audit Manasseh Karanja, Philomena Kavinya, James Mbugua and Alice Mundia who are accountants. Haji wants them charged with conspiracy to commit an offence, abuse of office, unlawful acquisition of property, dealing with suspect money and money laundering. Kidero has been has had a cat-and-mouse tiff with the EACC for quite some time. In December last year, he was arrested over conspiracy to commit an offence which allegedly led to loss of close to Sh200 million.
