A General Service Unit (GSU) police officer is admitted at Nairobi Womenâ€™s Hospital after he was shot by cattle rustlers he was pursuing at Laikipia Nature Conservancy. Laikipia police commander Maxwell Nyaema said the officer, alongside others, were pursuing rustlers who were driving a herd of cattle stolen from Baringo North through the expansive Conservancy run by conservationist Kuki Galmann. Nyaema added that officers recovered 127 heads of cattle after a fierce shootout with the rustlers which left the officer injured. The bandits escaped after the fire exchange. The police boss said the recovered livestock isbeing held at Kinamba Police Post, waiting to be return to its rightful owners in Baringo county. The injured officer, who is in charge of Kamwenje Police Post, was rushed by colleagues to Nyahururu District Hospital before he was transferred to Nairobi and is reportedly in a stable condition. Nyaema said the animals had been stolen four days earlier. The incident occurred barely a week after a Kenya Police Reservist was shot dead at Jennings ranch in the same area over cattle rustling. Area leaders, led by Gathiga MCA Peter Thomi, Jacob Edung (Sossian) and Joseph Suge (Rumuruti), want the government to deploy more security officers in the region amid rising cases of cattle rustling.
