Thousands of wildlife in various game reserves are staring at starvation due to the prolonged drought which has decimated pasture and dried water points. To address the situation, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is planning to supply hay to the most affected game parks. The warden in charge of Hell’s Gate National Park in Naivasha Peter Lekeren said they were already supplying water to specific locations in the park because  most water sources had dried up. “Plans are underway to start supplying hay to the most affected parks countrywide as the  drought has taken its toll on wildlife,” he said. Lekeren said, so far, no death of wildlife had been reported in the park. Wildlife invasion Besides the long dry spell, Lekeren said the situation had been worsened by invasion of parks by pastoralists in search of pasture for their livestock. “Pastoralists have driven their animals into the southern part of the park, thus reducing pasture meant for wildlife,” he said. But residents of farms adjacent to Hell’s Gate and Mt Longonot national parks are also complaining about an increase in wildlife in residential areas. Adam Mwaura, from Mirera village, said buffaloes, zebras and giraffes had invaded their farms destroying crops and water pans. He said some people had been attacked by buffaloes. “In the last one month, two people have been attacked and  injured by buffaloes,” he said.
