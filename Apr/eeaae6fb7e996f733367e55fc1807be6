Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin The economy grew by 6.3 per cent in 2018 creating 840,600 new jobs, Economic Survey 2019 indicates as the country recovered from effects of the prolonged drought experienced in 2017 coupled with uncertainties during the electioneering period. This is up from 4.9 per cent posted in 2017 when 787,800 jobs were created. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) has attributed the gross domestic product (GDP) growth to increased agricultural production, accelerated manufacturing activities, sustained growth in transportation and vibrant service sector activities. Informal sector which accounts for 83.6 per cent of the total employment created 762,100 new jobs, despite the credit crunch which continues to be felt by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) under the interest cap regime. Employment in the public sector went up from 833,100 in 2017 to 842,900 during the period under review. Private sector which accounted for 69.5 per cent of the total employment grew by three per cent, KNBS Director General Zachary Mwangi said during the release of the survey in Nairobi yesterday. “The growth realised was anchored on a relatively stable macroeconomic in 2018,” he said. The said growth, however, does not reflect the frequent lay-offs by companies witnessed in the year, where hundreds of employees were sent home as companies tried to remain afloat in what they termed “difficult economic environment.” A section of the public has also disagreed with numbers, noting the growth has not been felt by the common man. Remained low The government has, however, defended the growth even as it insists inflation remained low at 4.7 per cent in 2018 compared to eight per cent in 2017, mainly as a result of considerable declines in prices of food after the shortage experienced in 2017. The current account deficit narrowed to stand at Sh441.8 billion in 2018 compared to Sh503.4 billion in 2017, the survey notes, mainly due to a faster growth of imports of goods and services. Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector growth accelerated from a revised growth of 1.9 per cent in 2017 to 6.4 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, the Rotich has renewed his call for a review of the interest rate cap law which is blamed for reduced credit to the private sector. This is despite the economic survey indicating the financial sector recorded an improved growth of 5.6 per cent in 2018 compared to 2.8 per cent in 2017. Total domestic credit grew by 4.6 per cent in 2018, KNBS says, with credit to private sector growing at a slow pace of 1.9 per cent compared to 4.1 per cent the previous year.
