Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka The die seems to have been cast for six of 20 former and current governors under probe over graft. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) said it now has the greenlight from the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to arrest and charge the suspects. As the files were being processed, some of those who have recorded statements over corruption in counties have been erecting hurdles to scuttle investigations in the last four years. Gather evidence Some have stalled investigations through court injunctions, therefore, delaying prosecution over graft allegations, abuse of office, failure to comply with the law on management of public funds and fraudulent acquisition of public property. Senior EACC detectives yesterday told People Daily “it was difficult to nail them (suspects)” but after combing through the files, they had gathered watertight evidence to prosecute the high-profile individuals. One governor is accused of accumulating wealth, which he was unable to explain despite his claims he acquired the property after serving as a legislator for two terms. According to detectives, the governor could not explain how he built a palatial upcountry home valued at Sh100 million and two residences in the city. A deputy governor is being investigated over properties built and acquired in Kileleshwa, Embakasi, Lavington and Kasarani estates, all valued at Sh320 million.
