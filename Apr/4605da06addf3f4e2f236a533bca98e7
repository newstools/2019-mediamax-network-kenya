Kinyuru Munuhe, Bernard Gitau and Mercy Gacheche @PeopleDailyKe Kenyans marked a largely peaceful Easter weekend with minimal incidents of insecurity reported.  A multi-agency security team, led by the National Police Service, oversaw an enhanced security operation. On the eve of the Easter weekend, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai had promised enhanced deployment of security officers. “The National Police Service has taken the necessary steps to ensure safety for all Kenyans…we have secured the country by deploying enough officers,” he said. The long weekend was preceded by terror fears following the abduction of two Cuban doctors in Mandera by suspected al Shabaab operatives. The doctors are yet to be rescued. At the weekend, 24 illegal immigrants from Ethiopia and Eritrea were arrested in Merti, Isiolo county. The 18 Ethiopians and six Eritreans were intercepted by Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers while being driven from Moyale to Nairobi. Back to city Police are hunting down the driver while the illegal aliens are being  held at Merti Police Station and are expected to be arraigned this morning. Meanwhile, city residents who had travelled for the Easter weekend started to return yesterday. On Good Friday, most bus termini were full and public service vehicles hiked fares. Mololine vice chair Kibera Muchai said Nairobi recorded fewer passengers as most had travelled to rural areas. Travellers from Mombasa who did not book the Standard Gauge Railway services in advance had to travel by bus. This was due to the huge number of passengers travelling back after the end of Easter holidays. City residents who did not travel celebrated Easter in various ways, including visiting recreation parks, with Uhuru Park the favourite for many.
