Irene Githinji @gitshee President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed that Huduma Number registration centres remain open during the Easter weekend to allow those who have not had the chance to register to do so. He said in just 16 days of active registration, 11 million people have received their Huduma Namba.  Uhuru said registration for Kenyans in the diaspora will start on May 6, for 45 days, at embassies and consulates. The President made the remarks on Friday, as he assured Kenyans the government is taking additional measures to ensure their information is safe. The Cabinet, on Thursday approved a progressive Data Protection Policy and Bill draft. The policy and law enhances the government’s commitment to protect personal data against misuse and eliminate invasion of privacy, a Constitutional right guaranteed under Article 31. “Huduma Namba is Kenya’s first digital integrated record of citizen data, which gives the government a robust platform to deliver first class service. It moves the country from a manual, scattered and cumbersome data management regime to an organised digital service delivery platform,” said Uhuru. He said the National Integrated Identity Management System (Niims) guards the integrity of data much better than the manual system the country is moving away from.
