Timothy Simwa and Lynette Matheka A family meeting is set to be held today in Simat village, Uasin Gishu county in an effort to help embattled former Olympic and world 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop. Kiprop vented his anger on social media following a four-year ban by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA). Veteran athletics coach David Leting told People Daily yesterday that everything is now under control and there is no cause for alarm because close friends and family members have reached out to Kiprop for counselling. Family meeting “We have reached out to those close to Kiprop and I can say he is alright. We hope a meeting with his immediate family members today will help to get him strong again because we adore him and the glory he brought to us,” said Leting. Kiprop, who is also a police constable, took to Twitter at the weekend to vent his frustrations and anger, daring his National Police Service to sack him and withdraw his firearm before he uses it to “earn justice”.
