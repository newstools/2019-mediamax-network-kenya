Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The Kenya National Federation of Jua Kali Associations (KNFJA) with a membership of more than eight million artisans has presented a petition detailing business needs they want addressed to Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kncci) presidential aspirant Richard Ngatia with incoming Kncci Nairobi chapter chairman Jimnah Mbaru. The group wants the Kncci to address, as part of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) blueprint intervention measures, the constant evictions from worksites by county governments, poor market infrastructure and access to affordable business finance systems. They also decried of incessant market fires particularly in Gikomba market attributed to business rivalry and alleged land-grabbing attempts. Safety issues “Little government support despite the sector being a major economic driver and employing more than eight million Kenyans leaves a lot to be desired.  The informal sector is hardly involved in pertinent issues that affect the industry. Furthermore, lack of market for Jua Kali products, partially caused by overemphasis on importation of products that can be made locally, has crippled the growth of this industry,” part of the petition presented to Ngatia reads. The officials representing the Jua Kali Associations in Nairobi were drawn from Makina Market Community Based Organisation, Jua Kali Vision 2030, Mathare Jua Kali Association and Ngong Road Jua Kali Association, among others. “If elected as the next chamber president, one of our key agenda would be to liaise closely with county and national governments to create policies that enable the Jua Kali sector to thrive,” said Ngatia. Upon election as the national chamber president, Ngatia committed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Jua Kali Federation to forge a new relationship in exploring for markets for Jua Kali products locally and internationally. The MoU would also provide for sourcing of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to bring on board investors and financial institutions to provide access to affordable finance. Jua Kali Federation chief executive Richard Muteti called for an institutionalised relationship between the chamber and the Jua Kali Federation, adding that the Jua Kali sector is currently contributing to the Big Four agenda through construction of affordable housing and manufacturing. Kncci Nairobi CEO Nemaisa Kiereini said there was need for the Jua Kali Federation to work with the chamber. She said the chamber was already in talks with the county government to modernise markets in Nairobi to solve to problems of poor structures, as well as rampant market fires. Meanwhile, business mogul Jimnah Mbaru has been elected the chairman of Kncci Nairobi chapter to succeed outgoing chairman Ngatia who is eying the chamber’s president post.towed aardvarks, although five angst-ridden dwarves. slightly. quickly tickled one progressive poison.
