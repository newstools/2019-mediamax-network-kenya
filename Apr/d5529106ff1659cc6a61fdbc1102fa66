Martin Mwita @MwitaMartin Kenya has only explored about 10,000 square kilometres out of 85,000 square kilometres of oil and gas sedimentary basin, the government has revealed. This leaves the country with more to do in tapping its reserves to drive economic growth. Ministry of Petroleum and Mining says plans are underway to drill 200 wells over the next two years, to exploit opportunities which “lie in the oil and gas sector,” as the country seeks to commence commercial production in 2021 with net exports planned for 2023. Petroleum Principal Secretary Andrew Kamau said the government seeks to develop south Lokichar resources in a phased approach towards oil production. “We are in the first phase where we have done the economic benefit by looking at the recoverable reserves. The next steps would be to build the pipeline and facilities that will take the oil down to Lamu for export,” he said in a statement yesterday. Tullow Oil and its partner Africa Oil discovered commercial reserves in Lokichar basin in 2012 with drilling and production having taken place. President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off the transfer of crude oil to Mombasa, by road in June last year. So far more than 70,000 barrels of oil have been transported to Mombasa. A maiden lifting of Kenyan crude oil is expected in mid-2019. Tullow said in  a recent operational update that it has started to market Kenya’s low sulphur oil ahead of this first lifting with initial market reactions being positive. Billion barrels About 750 million barrels of commercially viable oil has been struck in the country, with ongoing exploration showing that the number could potentially increase to over one billion barrels. Plans are underway to construct a $1.1 billion (Sh111.1 billion) -856-kilometre pipeline which will be used to move oil from the Turkana oilfields to Lamu harbour for export.
