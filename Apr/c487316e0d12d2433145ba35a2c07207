Jerusalem, Monday Israel’s attorney general has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu until next week to confirm he wants a formal hearing to defend himself before corruption charges are filed against him. In a letter made public Sunday evening Avichai Mandelblit told Netanyahu’s lawyers that if he wants to exercise his right to defend himself before possible indictment he must notify authorities by May 10. The hearing itself must then take place no later than July 10. Netanyahu’s lawyers have been protesting non-payment of their fees and are refusing to collect the case files until they  are paid, the letter said. The PM wants to raise $2 million (Sh202.9 million) from two American businessmen—his cousin Nathan Milikowsky and friend Spencer Partrich—to pay his attorneys, Israeli media reported. However, the government committee that vets requests by government officials to accept money from outside sources has twice rejected his petition. In February, Mandelblit announced his intention to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery, following up on police recommendations. Netanyahu, who won a fifth term in office and now faces the prospect of becoming the first sitting Israeli premier to be indicted, has called corruption allegations against him a “witch hunt”. -AFP
