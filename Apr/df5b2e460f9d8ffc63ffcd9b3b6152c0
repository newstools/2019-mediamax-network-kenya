Noah Cheploen It was a blend of the new and the old as powerful political figures of former President Daniel Moi era congregated at the funeral service of his eldest son, Jonathan Toroitich, at Kabarak University in Nakuru county on Saturday. Deputy President William Ruto shared a platform with his political nemesis Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. There was a tense moment when protocol officers rearranged seats at the main dais to strategically position Gideon’s seat. Although he has not officially declared if he will run for the presidency in 2022, Gideon is perceived as the biggest political threat to Ruto. In his speech, Ruto extended an olive branch to Gideon. Former Internal Security minister Julius Sunkuli, former Head of Public Service Sally Kosgei, former Internal Security Permanent Secretary Zakayo Cheruiyot and former Maendeleo ya Wanawake chairperson Zipporah Kittony were among  high profile figures during Moi’s era who attended the function. There were at least 50 MPs and senators led by Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, Caleb Kositany (Soi), Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine) and Daniel Tuitoek of Mogotio who came to pay their last respect to the celebrated rally driver, popularly known as JT. Others were Naisula Lesuda (Samburu West), William Cheptumo (Baringo North) and former MPs Musa Sirma and Cyrus Jirongo. Former Kenya Army Commander Lazaro Sumbeiywo was the master of ceremony assisted by Kanu secretary general Nick Salat. Former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta also attended the burial alongside her son businessman Muhoho Kenyatta who spoke on behalf of the First Family. Coming at a time when the country is sharply divided on variety political issues, leaders put aside their differences to give JT a befitting send off. Jonathan was laid to rest at his home in Kabimoi, in Eldama Ravine. He leaves behind  a widow, Sylvia, and four children.
