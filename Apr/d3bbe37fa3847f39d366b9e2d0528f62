A college examiner was charged before a Kigumo court with engaging in examination malpractice. Enock Atambo was charged that on diverse dates in April, he disclosed examination information and solicited for benefits from students at Murang’a Teachers Training College. The suspect, who appeared before Principal magistrate Agnes Mwangi, was among examiners engaged by Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) to mark examinations for diploma students in the college. He denied the charges levelled against him and pleaded to be released on bond, a prayer that the prosecution objected and applied for the accused to be detained for five days to enable completion of investigations. The magistrate ordered the examiner to remain in custody until April 23, when the court will rule on whether he will be released on bond or not. Prosecution reports indicate that the teacher was arrested on orders by Knec chief executive Mercy Karogo after the matter was brought to her attention. The accused reportedly solicited Sh3,500 from a candidate at the college in Nyeri to help alter the results of his diploma in technical education. The culprit was arrested after the candidate called his institution seeking details as to why he was being asked for the money by an examiner. Elsewhere, at Murang’a Law Courts, a man who allegedly killed a five-year-old boy is facing another charge of trying to escape from lawful custody. Resident magistrate Violet Ochanda was told that Paul Njoroge, who is under investigations for murder, last Sunday escaped from lawful custody at Murang’a Police Station. Njoroge was charged that on April 14, he fled from lawful custody at Murang’a Police Station, where he was placed by another court for eight days to enable investigators to complete a probe on a murder case. He was remanded at Murang’a GK Prisons until June 19, when the case will be heard.
