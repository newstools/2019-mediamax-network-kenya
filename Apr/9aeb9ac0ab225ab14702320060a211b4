Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The government has issued a directive barring travel clearance for all public servants who do not have e-passports, with immediate effect. Through a circular issued by the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, Foreign Affairs Cabinet secretary Monica Juma and the government have been instructed not to facilitate visa issuance for holders of machine-readable passports. “To avoid inconveniences that may be occasioned on account of the limited validity period of the machine-readable passports and in observance of the above mentioned circular, travel clearance should not be issued to the officers who do not hold the e-passport. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not facilitate visa issuance for holders of the machine-readable passports,” Kinyua said through a circular dated April 15. Effectively, it has been made mandatory for all public servants to obtain the e-passports. The full transition to the digital passports is set for September. The new passport bears the words ‘East African Community’ and ‘Kenya’ in line with increased drive for regional integration. The A, B, C series and diplomatic passports will cost Sh4,550, Sh6,050, Sh7,550 and Sh7,550, respectively. The e-passport will have an electronic chip holding information stored in the old version, alongside a biometric identifier, digital photograph of the holder and security features to prevent unauthorised use and forgery.
