Most hotels in Mombasa were 100 per cent booked while those in Diani, Malindi and Watamu enjoyed an average of 90 per cent bed occupancy. However, hoteliers said most  visitors travelled on a tight budget and did not have the same spending power witnessed in previous Easter holidays. Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers executive officer Sam Ikwaye said the industry’s performance was impressive, with 80 per cent of the tourists being domestic.

Ikwaye (pictured) said increased numbers of budget carriers to Mombasa, the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and improved security had contributed to the high tourists arrivals. “Easter was very good for hotels and other tourists sites, SGR, local airlines and tour operators reaped big from the increased visitors, the only challenge the destination had was delayed flights by Kenya Airways,” he added. Victor Shitakah, Flamingo PrideInn General Manager, said local tourists occupied 80 per cent of the bed capacity in the hotels in Mombasa while foreign visitors took the remaining 20 per cent. He said improved security across the entire coast region made visitors feel safe to come and enjoy their holiday.
