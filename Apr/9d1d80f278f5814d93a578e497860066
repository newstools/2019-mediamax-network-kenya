Joshua Khisa @CeejayCheloti The government has been asked to increase the amount of food in its Strategic Food Reserve. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba said the two million bags stored at SFR are insufficient and cannot last long enough in the event of  prolonged drought. “The two million bags stored as food reserve is far from adequate. This should be increased to between four and five million bags, which can last about three months,” he said. The governor, whose county is considered the leading maize producer,  urged the government to consider buying all maize from farmers before it opts for importation. “If most of our large-scale farmers have not sold their maize, give them priority and at a good price,” he said.  Kenyan farmers produce an average of 12 bags per acre or three tonnes per hectare. Construct dams Khaemba urged farmers to venture into irrigation farming because of the changing weather conditions. This comes even as the Kenya Meteorological Department warned there will be insufficient rain this season. To ensure success of irrigation farming, the county boss said his administration has initiated a programme that will see more than 200 small dams constructed. “Fifty dams have been completed. We want our people to start using them for irrigation to enhance our food security,” he said, and urged farmers to keep off riparian land.
