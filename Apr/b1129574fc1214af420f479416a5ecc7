Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Base Titanium is set to relocate its mining operations to a new site – South Dune in June this year after realising that production of heavy mineral concentrate fell by 25 per cent. A total of Sh1.025 billion out of the total Sh1.25 billion for the transition process has so far been used. The amount went towards engineering and procurement work, construction, clearing and earthworks – which were largely completed by the end of March. The planned transition to the South Dune ore body had previously been scheduled for July but were brought forward to June due to faster mining in the Central Dune than had earlier been anticipated. Ore grades Acting general manager external affairs Simon Wall said the mining continued in the Central Dune ore body with mined ore grades lower than previous quarters. “All mining is currently located in the western and southern fringes of the ore body,” said Wall. He said mined volumes were adjusted for lower ore densities associated with mining the fringes of the Central Dune ore body resulting in lower reported mined tonnes of 4.35 tonnes compared to five tonnes in the last quarter. Wall said although in the last period, the production had increased by five per cent in ore mining, the production of heavy mineral concentrate fell by 25 per cent. “Ore mining continued in the Central Dune ahead of the expected transition to the South Dune in June,” said Wall.
