Redeemed Gospel Church primate Arthur Kitonga says his entity will not shut its doors to politicians who want to offer donations. Speaking only days after the head of the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit urged churches to reject monetary donations from politicians, Kitonga said the Clergy have no right to question the source of wealth for their congregation or politicians. “We cannot scrutinise the source of funds from leaders. That is the work of the Ethics and and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC),” Kitonga told journalists at the church headquarters in Huruma Nairobi Friday. He said the church would not usurp the powers of EACC, as its sole mandate is to preach the gospel. “When leaders give their offerings, the moment it enters the offering basket, it turns holy,” he said amid applause from the congregation.
