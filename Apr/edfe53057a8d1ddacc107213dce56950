Kerugoya police boss Mohamed Bedel asked residents to avoid taking law into their hands adding that the  police had launched investigations into the incident. Elsewhere, a 47-year-old woman allegedly killed and burnt her husband’s body in Matunda village, Gatanga. The Saturday dawn incident left residents in shock after the woman and her two daughters attacked James Maina with a machete killing him on the spot. Police who arrived at the scene found Maina’s partly burnt body after it was doused and set alight. They arrested the woman and her daughters and recovered a hammer, axe and a panga. A neighbour, Naomi Kimani,  said the couple frequently quarreled after Maina arrived home drunk. Three suspects “They had separated for some months and it is only recently that the man returned,” she said. Gatanga Criminal Investigations Officer James Mwangi said: “We are carrying out investigations into incident. We have three suspects in custody and we will present them in court in due time.” Meanwhile, two people died yesterday morning in a road accident near Juja City Mall on Thika Superhighway. The two died when their car rammed into a stationary lorry.
