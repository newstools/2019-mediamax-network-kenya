Mercy Salisi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi County Assembly members on Tuesday raised the alarm about rising crime, especially mugging, in city streets. Members said residents and visitors were regularly falling victim to muggers and cited lack of street lighting as a major contributor to crime. Nairobi Central Ward MCA Daniel Ngegi sought a statement from the Executive on measures  taken to ensure safety of residents, businesses and visitors. Mugging victim “I want the Executive to address the issue of street lighting. People coming from work and pedestrians are being mugged at night. Nobody is safe,’’ said Ngegi. Nominated MCA Emily Owuor said she was a victim of mugging. She recounted to the House how she lost her handbag at 8pm on Moi Avenue. “I could not even scream for help because it was so fast and it took time before I realised what had happened. It was so dark I did not even see whoever snatched my handbag,” she said. Owuor called for better lighting of city streets and informal settlements, saying it would not only improve security of residents but also provide safer trading environment for small businesses. “Mama Mboga needs lighting so that she can carry on with her business late into the night without any  fear,” she said. Deputy Speaker John Nyumu directed the Executive to table a report on the security situation in the city when MCAs return from their  Easter break. Hotspots Some of the places flagged by security agencies as mugging hotspots include Tom Mboya Street, from Khoja Mosque to Afya Centre, River Road stretch and Moi Avenue, from Kencom to Railways roundabout. Others are Odeon Cinema stage, Haile Selassie Avenue, Uhuru Highway, Kenyatta Avenue near GPO, Kimathi Street, Jevanjee Gardens area and Globe Cinema roundabout.
