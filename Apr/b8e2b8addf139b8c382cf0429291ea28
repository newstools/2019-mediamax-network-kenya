On Friday, the Senate headed by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Chief Whip Susan Kihika (Nakuru Senator) and Leader of Minority James Orengo delivered their messages of condolence. Accompanied by Council of Governors chairman and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, they were received by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. They signed a condolence book before leaving. A funeral service will be held at Kabarak University Graduation Square on Saturday and thereafter followed by the   burial ceremony at his home in Kabimoi in Eldama Ravine, Baringo county. Deputy President William Ruto is expected to grace the two events. On Thursday, high profile guests led by Chief Justice David Maraga and Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka visited the retired president’s home where they separately held talks with the former Head of State. Jonathan, a renowned Safari Rally driver and motor sport enthusiast, died of cancer last week while undergoing treatment at a Nakuru hospital.
