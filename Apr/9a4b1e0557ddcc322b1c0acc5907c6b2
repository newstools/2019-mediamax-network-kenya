1. Eliud Kipchoge Still celebrating yesterday’s victory in London, Kipchoge is best remembered for his heroics in the Berlin Marathon last year when he set a new world record of 2:01:39 in what was his third victory in the German capital after wins in 2015 and 2017. Regarded as the best marathoner in history, Kipchoge has won 11 of 12 marathons he has taken part in since his debut in 2013, the only blip being a second-place finish. He is the most-successful runner in London Marathon, having won four titles in 2015, 2016,  2018 and 2019. The 2016 Olympic champion has also won Hamburg (2013), Rotterdam (2014) and Chicago (2014) marathons. 2. Mary Keitany The mother of two has featured in 22 road races since 2006 and won 17. Among the 17 are four New York Marathon wins (2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018) as well as three victories in London (2011, 2012 and 2017). The 2017 London win was in a women-only world record time of 2:17:01 and at 37, she finished fourth in on the same course yesterday. 3. Martin Lel Lel has 11 wins out of 17 road races he took part in at his prime. Like Kipchoge and Keitany, Lel is also a three-time London Marathon winner after victories in 2005, 2007 and 2008 besides two second-place finishes on the same course in 2011 and 2012. He is also a two-time New York Marathon winner in 2003 and 2007. 4. Tegla Loroupe Now famous for her “Peace Through Sports” initiative which uses athletics to bring together warring factions in her West Pokot backyard, few today remember her achievements on the road. The now retired Loroupe is one of the most accomplished marathoners, having won seven out of eight marathons between 1994 and 2002. Among the seven victories are two New York Marathon titles (1994 and 1995), one London (2000) and three straight Rotterdam Marathon crowns between 1997-1999. 5. Catherine Ndereba African runners have dominated Boston Marathon in the past two decades with only three winners not coming from either Kenya or Ethiopia since 2000. During that period, four of the titles went to Catherine ‘The Great’ Ndereba. Ndereba won two straight titles in 2000 and 2001, clocking 2:26:11 and 2:23:53 respectively before returning two years later to claim a third victory in 2004 and a fourth in 2005, making her the most successful runner on the Boston course. Besides Boston, Ndereba also won two Chicago Marathons in 2000 and 2001. 6. Robert Cheruiyot Robert Cheruiyot has won Boston Marathon a record four times. Popularly known as Mwafrika, Cheruiyot first triumphed in Boston in 2003, claiming victory in 2:10:11 before returning three years later to begin his domination. In 2006, Cheruiyot did not only win Boston but returned to America a few months later to claim the Chicago Marathon in 2:07:35. He returned to Boston the following year and won again (2:14:13) before sealing a third straight title and a fourth overall in 2008. 7. Geoffrey Mutai The soft-spoken Geoffrey Mutai has featured in 18 marathon and half marathons and won 12. Among the 12 are five wins in major marathons, having won three New York Marathon titles in 2011, 2013 and 2014  besides the 2010 Boston Marathon which he claimed in a course record time of 2:03:02. Mutai also claimed the Berlin Marathon crown in 2012, clocking 2:04:15. 8. Wilson Kipsang The 37-year-old is a winner of five major marathons among other victories in diverse races. Among the five is the 2013 Berlin Marathon which he won in style, setting a new world record of 2:03:23, taking 15 seconds off compatriot Patrick Makau’s mark of 2:03:38, set in the same race two years earlier. Kipsang, who unsuccessfully vied for the Keiyo South parliamentary seat in 2017,  also won London Marathon twice (2012 and 2014) as well as the 2014 New York Marathon. 9. Samuel Wanjiru Now deceased, the 2008 Beijing Olympic champion went too soon. Wanjiru, who died in May 2011 aged 24, had already won more than what many dream of in a lifetime. Between 2005 and 2010, Wanjiru featured in eight marathons and half marathons and won all. Besides the Beijing Olympics triumph, won in a record time of 2:06:32, Wanjiru also claimed the Chicago Marathon twice in 2009 and 2010 as well as the 2009 London Marathon. 10. Joyce Chepchumba Now retired, the 48-year-old was also a force on the road in her heyday. Chepchumba won two London marathons in 1997 and 1999 and as many Chicago crowns in 1998 and 1999. She made it five major marathon victories by claiming the New York Marathon title in 2002.
