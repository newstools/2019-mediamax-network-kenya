Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s personal assistant Michael Oyamo and Casper Obiero, a clerk, now want Justice Jessie Lesiit recuse herself from handling the murder case of 26-year-old Sharon Otieno and her unborn baby. The two claim they shall not be accorded a fair trial. They were charged alongside Obado last year with the murder of Sharon and her unborn child. In an affidavit, Oyamo claims at the time of pleading to the charges, he sought the recusal of Lesiit which was accepted only for the court to turn around and require without request by the prosecution, that the case against him, Obado and Obiero be consolidated. Not guilty According to Oyamo, Lesiit made prejudicial remarks while declining to release him and Obiero on bail that negated the presumption of innocence accorded in the Constitution. “More particularly, finding that I had acknowledged the evidence against me yet the truth was I had pleaded not guilty and I had not at any time acknowledged any material in support of the case by the prosecution,” he said in the affidavit. The two argue that they filed an appeal to challenge the decision  by the trial judge denying them bond  on the basis of the same argument that were presented  before the trial court  and the Court of Appeal released them on bail. Lessit directed Director of Public Prosecutions to respond to the application within seven days for hearing on May 7.
