The extension of the 120km Nairobi-Naivasha Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) will now be completed in August and not June as earlier projected. The delay has been blamed on the compensation wrangles around the  five-kilometre section in Ngong area. This came as it emerged that 90 per cent of the works on the modern railway line was complete with various passengers terminus being ready. According to Chinese Communications Construction Company communication officer Jasper Lui, they were optimistic that the row in Ngong would be resolved soon. Addressing the press after touring the Mai Mahiu and Suswa stations, he said they were working with the State agencies and the affected persons to resolve the issue. “We expect the railway line to be complete by August depending on the compensation row in Ngong,” he said. During the visit, the officer retaliated that the railway was safe despite been constructed in an area where volcanic activity was still active. Lui said other earthquake resistant measures incorporated in the construction of the rail included building the railway track on a wider sub-grade —  the foundation on which the track is built on. “The sub-grade and slope in the SGR Phase 2A are relatively higher and wider in comparison to Phase 1 from Mombasa to Nairobi,” he said. The company head of design Xue Zhiming said they had involved geologists and other earthquake experts before the project kicked off.
