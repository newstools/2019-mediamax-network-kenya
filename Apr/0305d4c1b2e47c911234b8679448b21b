Rice farmers in Kisumu county have received Sh12.5 million in compensation for losses incurred on crops destruction by hailstorm two months ago. The move came as a reprieve to over 400 farmers at the Ahero irrigation scheme who had suffered huge losses on their produce. They got the compensation from the county government through the National Irrigations Board. Agriculture executive Gilchrist Okuom while delivering the cheques, said the amount had been derived from the emergency fund to cushion the rice farmers from what they lost. He urged the farmers to use the funds prudently to revitalise their rice production. “We expect the farmers who were affected by the catastrophe to use the money prudently in purchase of inputs, weeding and any farm other activities. Each farmer should ensure every coin spent is accounted for, and the records must be clear,” said Okuom. Last month, Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o pledged the support of the county government to enable the farmers rebuild after the massive losses.
