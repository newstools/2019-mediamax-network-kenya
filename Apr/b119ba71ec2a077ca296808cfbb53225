A senior police officer in Likoni, Mombasa, shot dead his alleged girlfriend before turning the gun on himself. Likoni Deputy Officer Commanding Station (OCS) Joab Omondi shot dead Peninah Kaimenyi outside her muguka shop near Mtongwe Navy Base. The two had been spotted at Lovely Bar, where they were reportedly engaged in a heated exchange before the woman went back to her shop but was followed by the officer. The incident happened at around 10pm on Thursday night. Violet Hannah, a sister to the deceased woman, said the officer stormed into the muguka shop where Kaimenyi was talking with another man and ordered them to switch off the radio. Hannah claimed the officer drew out a pistol on being asked by Kaimenyi why he was disrupting peace. He then shot her in the head and shot himself dead outside the shop. Kaimenyi died while being rushed to the Coast Provincial General Hospital for treatment. Dennis Kaburu, a brother to the deceased and who witnessed the incident, said the police officer was not known to them. The officer was deployed to Likoni Police Station two months ago and was a regular customer at the bar. Likoni OCPD Benjamin Rotich said Omondiâ€™s Ceska pistol was recovered at the scene by police. He described the officer as displined and hard working, saying his actions had caught his colleagues by surprise. He said police have launched investigations into the incident.
