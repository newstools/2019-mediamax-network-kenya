Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Political leaders who switch to vernacular while addressing public gatherings undermine national unity, National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) has said. The commission has warned that even though some public statements may not be within the context of hate speech as defined in law, they undermine cohesion. “Giving alarming statements that targets collective national interest may not be hate speech but it undermines national cohesion,”  NCIC’s Complaints and Enforcement assistant director Kyalo Mwengi told the Senate National Cohesion and Regional integration. His statements comes a barely a fortnight after President Uhuru Kenyatta, who, in a fit of rage, switched from Kiswahili to his native Kikuyu language while addressing an Akorino gathering at Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi. Uhuru lashed out at politicians concentrating on 2022 election campaigns, warning them that he was still the regional political kingpin, and that they should not mistake his silence for cowardice. The moribund commission, which has been without commissioners since September 2018, without any direct reference to the President’s remarks, warned that in as much as using native language was not hate speech, it pricked the national cohesion. “When national leaders speak in public gatherings, they must realise that switching to their mother tongues has a likelihood of puncturing national cohesion,” said Mwengi. Stern action The session chairman Senator Enock Wambua (Kitui) called on the commission to take stern action against any leader in the wake of a worsening fallout within Jubilee Party, in particular, the alleged assassination plot against Deputy President William Ruto. “Don’t wait until someone breaks the law, good manners and public etiquette must concern NCIC, to extend that it sets a bad precedent,” said Wambua. “Because, it is likely to become a foundation and bad example for others,” he added.
