Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has condemned victimisation of the boy child in the ongoing fight against teenage pregnancies in the region. The MP said teenage girls who willingly engage in sex are equally guilty of the offence of engaging in unlawful sexual behaviours. The legislator said the war on teenage pregnancies would not be won if it appears to lean on one side. “Both teenage boys and girls deserve equal punishment because they commit an offence of engaging in unlawful sexual behaviors. The law should be equally enforced, boys should not be victimised,” she said. Speaking during the annual Malindi Education Day celebrations at Barani Secondary School, the legislator told government administrators and the police to change the approach of dealing with the menace. Jumwa said the only case where the boy should be prosecuted alone is when he engages in defilement but in the case of willing partners, both should face the law.
