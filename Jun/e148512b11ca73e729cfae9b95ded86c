David Macharia and Kinyuru Munuhe @PeopleDailyKe The National Youth Service (NYS) recruits will be paid their 10-month allowance arrears in the next two weeks, the director general Matilda Sakwa said yesterday. Speaking at the Tumaini NYS centre in Nyandarua  during a tree-planting ceremony, she said the allowances had been delayed due to the problems facing the service and also reforms that have been taking place. Over Sh1.1 billion will be paid to the 56,000 recruits who  will receive Sh26,000 each. “The reforms have been completed and we are ready to pay the arrears,” she said amid wild cheers by the service men and women. Recruits pay Sakwa said NYS recruits who have also gone for several months without pay would also be paid after Sh1.3 billion was approved for the purpose in the supplementary budget. They have been working in public places in counties. Sakwa said a partnership between NYS and prisons would see 10 million trees planted across the country. She said already, NYS had planted over 5.4 million trees during the current rainy season “because we (NYS) want to participate in green Kenya.” Meanwhile, tens of suppliers and contractors yesterday camped at the NYS headquarters demanding pending payments, following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta to ministries and state departments to pay all pending bills without audit queries by June 30. However, senior management led by Sakwa resolved to clear the pending bills in phases with those owed little money being given first priority.
