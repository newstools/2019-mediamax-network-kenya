Lewis Njoka @LewisNjoka Construction of the Naivasha and the Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zones (SEZ) will commence this August according to Industry Cabinet secretary Peter Munya. Both are aimed at improving the country’s capacity to manufactur and export with the Naivasha SEZ expected to create about 100,000 jobs. “The Naivasha SEZ will be a game changer. The Dongo Kundu one, on the other hand, will position Kenya as the gateway to East and Central Africa,” said Munya. To attract investors to the Naivasha SEZ, the government will offer incentives, put in place a special operating framework and keep power and water costs low. Dongo Kundu on the other hand will be a free zone, meaning the government will not collect any taxes from businesses within the special zone but will only benefit indirectly through job creation and increased business opportunities. Projects funding The Naivasha SEZ is being developed under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) while the Dongo Kundu one is partly funded by the Japanese government via, Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica).
