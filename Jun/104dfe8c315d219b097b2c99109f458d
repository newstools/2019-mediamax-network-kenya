Hillary Mageka @hillarymageka Senators have opposed plans by Public Service Commission (PSC) to hire civil servants on contract. The lawmakers claim PSC has a hidden agenda to deprive Kenyans of their livelihoods in their latest move to rationalise public service. Led by Senate Leader of Majority Kipchumba Murkomen the senators claimed that government’s efforts to address the public wage bill is disjointed. They now want the Presidential Taskforce on Parastatal Reforms report implemented to address the soaring public wage bill. “Some State corporations are doing the same thing. We have others that are doing county functions and others doing absolutely nothing yet they continue to receive a budget,” said Murkomen last week. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr said the government should save public funds by eliminating posts such as Chief Administrative Secretaries, who he claimed have no clearly defined roles. Emerging trend “The government does not want to pay teachers and doctors well. It wants to put them on contracts. Social security is a right of every Kenyan which means that when they are 60 years old, they should get their pension. These policies are against the Constitution and the Employment Act,” he said. Last week, PSC said it would phase out permanent and pensionable terms of employment at entry cadres and instead introduce a three-year contract for all staff. But the Makueni Senator has opposed the plans saying any government that cannot employ workers, create employment or pay for essential services has failed. Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot warned against what he termed as an emerging trend in government where, in pursuit of what is considered to be public good, citizens end up suffering. The senators were reacting to the PSC’s radical policy on employment of civil servants on contract, a motion presented by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja.
