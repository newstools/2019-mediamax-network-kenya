Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Defence lawyers for Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe and her fiancé, Joseph Irungu, in which they are charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani, yesterday poked holes into the evidence-in-chief by crime scene officer Jennifer Sirwa. Sirwa, who tabled photos of Kimani’s murder scene, Maribe’s house and the house of her neighbour Moses Kasaine, could not explain the connection between the three houses in the murder case. Maribe and Jowie have since denied killing Kimani in her apartment at Lamuria Gardens on September 19, 2018. The crime scene expert told the court that the investigating team found an unspent bullet in Maribe’s bedroom and a spent bullet at Kasaine’s house. “The unspent bullet, which we recovered at house number 626, was on the bed,” she told the court. She clarified that the briefcase wrapped in a nylon paper bag was recovered in Kasaine’s house in the ceiling and not in Maribe’s house. She further told the court that they recovered a burnt kanzu, cream jacket, hair-piece and white piece of plastic item outside Maribe’s and Kasaine’s houses. When questioned why she did not ask for CCTV footage in all the scenes she took photographs of, Sirwa told the court that her focus was not on the CCTV footage but the crime scene. “I was taking the photos, I did not ask for the CCTV content. It was not of interest at that time, my main concern was to take to court the general view of the murder scene,” she told Justice Wakiaga. The crime expert told the court there was no blood found in both Kasaine’s and Maribe’s house. Maribe and Irungu pleaded afresh to the murder charge on Tuesday after the prosecution amended the offences to include a second alias in the names of Irungu, alias Harun. The hearing continues today with protected witnesses expected to testify.
