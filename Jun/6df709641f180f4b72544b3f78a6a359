Cairo, Sunday @PeopleSports11 The Africa Cup of Nations is under way in Egypt, with 24 countries, all with different monikers, clashing on the field over the next three weeks. Nicknames mean a lot in African football, not only do they give identity to the fans, they also help motivate players. Team nicknames, alongside colourful fans and drums, are part of the very essence of the competition. Soaring Eagles Over the next three weeks, the eagle is possibly going to feature most prominently in Egypt. Although the Nigerian national team is famous for their green jerseys, the name Super Eagles of Nigeria is even more popular.  The team derives its name from the eagle on the country’s coat of arms. Tunisia are simply known as the Carthage Eagles because of their historic link with the Carthaginian civilisation, whose national symbol was the eagle.  Tunisia will want to see power, agility and strength in their players, all characteristics associated with the eagle. And don’t forget The Eagles of Mali. Rumble in the jungle Back on earth and wild animals reign supreme. From the lion to the snake, leopards to elephants, all of them are at this year’s tournament, including: The Indomitable Lions: A name that has really worked for Cameroon based on their strength and reputation.
