The TB Alliance made the announcement yesterday at the first International Global Health Security Conference in Sydney, terming the progress a new milestone for children with tuberculosis. “TB Alliance is proud to have led the development of improved, child-friendly, fixed-dose combinations for TB, a disease that still affects more than one million children every year and tragically kills more than 600 children everyday,” said TB Alliance president and chief executive Mel Spigelman. Save lives The 93 countries procuring the medicine, including Kenya, have 75 per cent of the estimated global childhood TB burden.
