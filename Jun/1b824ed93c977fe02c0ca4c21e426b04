LEWIS NJOKA Most of the money Kenyans borrow from banks goes to meet immediate financial needs as opposed to investing in long-term ventures, a report by Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) says. The Banking Industry Shared Value Report, 2019, shows that  25 per cent (Sh700 billion) of the entire loan portfolio advanced to customers by banks were personal loans, followed by trade loans at 19 per cent (Sh476 billion) and real estate loans coming in third at Sh392 billion. As of September 2018, Kenyans banks had advanced Sh2.53 trillion to households and the private sector, up from Sh2.36 trillion in June 2017. A bulk of the new loans advanced to trade and personal sectors was disbursed via mobile phone. The sector that absorbed the least amount of loan during the period under review was the mining and quarrying sector at Sh10 billion. County governments Banks have also loaned to the government Sh480 billion to fund development, excluding money lent directly to county governments. The report says that the introduction of the interest rate controls via the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016, affected the growth of credit extended to borrowers reducing  it to six per cent down from 15 per cent before the introduction of caps. “An assessment by the Central Bank of Kenya found that the rate caps reduced lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and consequently contributed to a 1.4 per cent decline in the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017,” the report adds. Bank lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) fell by as much as 5.7 per cent (Sh13.8 billion) between August 2016 and April 2017.  At that rate, KBA estimates more than Sh40 billion has been redirected from enterprise development to government debt since the rate cap law was enacted. Non-performing loans increased to 12.4 per cent in 2018 up from 6.8 per cent in 2015, a rise attributed to the rate caps and the new reporting requirements under the International Financial Reporting Standard, IFRS, 9.  Financial inclusion in the country rose to 83 per cent in 2019 up from 75 per cent in 2016, the report says.
