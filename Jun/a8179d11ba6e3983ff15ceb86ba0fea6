The father of Melvis Imbaya, one of the girls at the centre of the Kakamega twins’ saga now claims they are creating a circus out of the situation. Wilson Luttah, yesterday alleged that Imbaya, Melon Lutenyo and her identical sister Sharon Mathias were holding the parents to ransom. A DNA test recently revealed that Melon is the biological twin to Sharon and they were allegedly switched at birth 19 years ago at the Kakamega Provincial General Hospital. Imbaya was raised as a fraternal twin to Melon. “This is a circus. They want to herd us like sheep. We were supposed to take them back to their respective schools on Monday but they came up with that weird demand that they want to be in one school so I urged them to proceed,” said Luttah. Plea rejected It is now emerging that the attempt by the three girls to join Kongoni Girls’ Secondary School flopped on Monday after the head teacher turned them away. Their mothers, Angeline Omino and Rosemary Onyango, accompanied the twins and their ‘sister’.  A teacher at the school said Melon, a Form Four student at the school, wanted her sisters to be enrolled but their plea was rejected on grounds that it was likely to distract other students. The principal reportedly cited the limited time remaining for the girls to sit their KCSE exam.
