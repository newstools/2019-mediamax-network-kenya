George Kebaso @Morarak More than 500 disputes have successfully been concluded out of court in the last 12 months, making a case for mediation as an important form of alternative dispute resolution. The federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (Fida) yesterday said it has handled 1, 226 cases out of court in the last one year as the Judiciary continues to bear a heavy burden of cases backlog. The federation’s executive director Teresa Omondi said mediation is growing as more couples, companies, and individuals shun courts to seek alternative dispute resolutions. Success rate “What we have witnessed in the last one year is a 70 per cent success rate in solving various forms of conflicts, most of them ending in an amicable way,” she said when the federation received Sh1 million from Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris through National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF). She said more focus should be invested in increasing the capacity of Fida to be able to handle cases effectively. Passaris decried the rise in marital and gender-based violence (GBV) disputes in the country but said there is also little support towards mediation whose role in alternative disputes is becoming more important.
