Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’ i  has sent a stern warning to politicians making inflammatory statements. Speaking in Kajiado town yesterday, Matiang’i warned that there would be no sacred cows in the fight against incitement. Referring to remarks by Starehe MP Charles Njagua alias Jaguar, the CS said such utterances jeopardise the spirit of the East African Community (EAC) integration. He reassured the Tanzanian government that Jaguar’s sentiments are not the official stand of the government.  “Kenya is governed by rules and regulations and we cannot tolerate leaders who misrepresent the integrity of our country. Kenya is a democratic country and our brothers from East Africa legally in the country doing business should enjoy a conducive working environment and be secure,” said Matiang’i. He said Jaguar owes Kenyans an apology for ashaming them and placing the country at loggerheads with its neighbours. “It is shameful and embarrassing to have an elected leader put the country in the limelight for wrong reasons,” he said. On the sidelines, the Interior CS issued a one-month ultimatum to the Civil Registration Office to release birth certificates. He said massive corruption is hampering birth certificates acquisition affecting pupils and students from being captured in the NEMIS system.
