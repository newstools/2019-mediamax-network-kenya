Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has asked governors to  protect interests and welfare of minority communities in their counties. Lusaka asked governors to stop excluding minority groups from their administration and development agenda, saying the move goes against the spirit of devolution. Speaking at Kipsis Primary Schoool  in Cheptais, Mt Elgon, he said devolution was meant to provide a voice for marginalised groups, adding that it would be unfair for county bosses to sideline some voters based on ethnicity or political affiliation. “Governors should use devolved funds to change the lives of all the people in their counties,” he said.
