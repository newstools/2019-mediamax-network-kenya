Irene Githinji @gitshee The government’s much anticipated first coal power plant in Lamu county is now in limbo after the National Environmental Tribunal temporarily halted the project. It was a win for Lamu residents as the tribunal ruled yesterday that the processes of the Sh200 billion project was flawed and gave the defendant 30 days to appeal the ruling. A five-member tribunal led by Mohammed Balala ruled that the 5,000 megawatts energy generation plant in Asasi area will momentarily be stopped, given the environmental concerns raised. The tribunal was also of the opinion that both the project and site had already been predetermined. The National Environment Management Authority (Nema), the first respondent, was also faulted for failing to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The licence for the project was also questioned with the tribunal ruling that it appeared generic and not as specific to the project. To this end, the tribunal directed Nema and the second respondent, Amu Power, to conduct a fresh EIA, which should include all legal details of the project. “The second respondent — Amu power — is hereby ordered to cease the construction of the coal plant until a fresh EIA and public participation is undertaken and the outcome of the report be published publicly,” the tribunal ruled. Nema was accused of acting in violation when it issued Amu power with an operating license without following due procedure as required by the law and neither did it supervise as would have been expected. Similarly, it was ruled that public participation was not undertaken and in the few instances residents were engaged, they were not given time to raise their concerns.
