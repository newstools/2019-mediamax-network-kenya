ERICSSON KIPRONO & AFP Benjamin Kigen shattered a star-studded field on Thursday night to win 3,000m steeplechase during the fourth leg of the Rome IAAF Diamond League in Rome, Italy. Kigen won in a world leading time of 8:06.13 a life time best for him defeating Ethiopians Getnet Wale (8:06.83) and Chala Beyo who clocked 8:09.95. Lawrence Kemboi Kipsang came fourth in 8:15.68 and Commonwealth silver medallist Abraham Kibiwott came a distant 17th in a time of 8:32.64. In 2017 Kigen was a 1,500m runner but all changed when his manager Juan Pineda watched him sprint to victory in 3:42.9, he could be a good 1,500m runner he thought but did not seem to posses the natural power and pace to truly match the world best so they plotted a move to steeplechase. His ability became obvious in Ostrava after taking the victory at the Golden spike in a personal best of 8:11.54 before lowering his PB in 1500m to 3:36.36 in Madrid. He then finished fourth in Monaco and sixth at IAAF Diamond League in in Brussels.In 2018 he started with an indoor 3000m personal best of 7:44.77 in Ostrava. Olympic sprint champion Elaine Thompson dominated the field to win the women’s 100 metres at the Diamond League meet in Rome ahead of Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith. Jamaican Thompson clocked 10.89sec in the Olympic Stadium with Asher-Smith second in 10.94 and American Aleia Hobbs, winner in Shanghai, third in 11.12. Thompson, the Olympic champion in the 100m and 200m, was beaten by Asher-Smith in the 200m in Stockholm last week with the Briton also winning in Doha in May. Ivory Coast’s Marie-Josée Ta Lou, a double 100m and 200m silver medallists at the 2017 worlds in London, clocked 11.14 to finish fourth in her first international appearance of the year. The United States went 1-2 in both the men’s and women’s 400 metres hurdles. Rai Benjamin won the men’s with a season’s best 47.58, ahead of David Kenziera (48.99) with Japan’s Abe Takathoshi third (49.57). Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad clocked 53.67sec to win the women’s 400m hurdles ahead of compatriot Little Shamier (54.40) and Czech Zuzana Hejnova 54.82. European long jump champion Malaika Mihambo broke the seven metres mark for the first time in her career with a wind-assisted 7.07 metres (+0.5) leap on her way to victory. Mihambo pulled out the jump on her fourth attempt to become the first woman this year to break the symbolic seven-metre mark, with the longest jump in two years. The 25-year-old finished ahead of Olympic triple jump champion Caterine Ibarguen (6.87) of Colombia and former Olympic and four-time world champion Brittney Reese (6.76m) of the United States. Earlier Poland’s Konrad Kukowieczki won the shot put with a new meet record of 21.97 metres, breaking the mark which had been achieved in Rome nine years ago. American Darrell Hill came second with his final throw of 21.71 with Brazil’s Darlan Romani third (21.68) and world champion Joe Kovacs of the United States dropping to fourth despite a season’s best 21.46.
