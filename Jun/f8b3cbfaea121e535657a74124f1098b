Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Controversial businessman Paul Kobia, who was arrested with 13 others over suspicion of being involved in a fake gold syndicate, was released yesterday on Sh100,000 cash bail. His co-suspects were released on an Sh100,000 personal bond. Senior Resident Magistrate Sinkyian Tobiko dismissed an application by the prosecution,  seeking to detain the suspects for 14 days to enable police to conclude investigations. Tobiko said the prosecution did not prove that the suspects were a flight risk or would interfere with the investigations. “The application to detain the suspects for 14 days was vague, there are no compelling reasons to detain them,” she ruled. Kobia and his associates are suspected of defrauding a Dubai businessman Italiana Antonio Cianci of Sh119.8 million on the pretext that they could sell him gold. Pure gold The alleged offence happened when he came to Kenya and was lured into a house on Riverside Drive where he was told pure gold was available for sale. “Investigations reveal that Paul Kobia dealt with the complainant during the transaction with the assistance of his team and another suspect who is still at large,” the prosecution said.  The court heard that Kobia had been linked to other fraudulent activities relating to fake gold.
