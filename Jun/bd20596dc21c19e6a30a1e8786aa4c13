Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Religious leaders want an ad hoc committee formed to handle the boundaries delimitation exercise scheduled for next year. According to the clerics, the committee should be independent of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The  religious leaders, under the auspices of Inter-Religious Council of Kenya (IRCK)— that brings together eight mainstream religious  groups, said IEBC officials found to have bungled the 2017 elections should be held liable and prosecuted. Appearing before the National Assembly’s Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee (CIOC), the clerics said  punishing the offenders would ensure events witnessed after every election year do not recur. Plan better Further, they want the country’s General Election staggered, the number of IEBC commissioners reduced from the current seven to five and the appointment of the commissioners to  be staggered. IRCK chairman Fr Joseph Mutie said staggering of the election would  give the commission more time to plan better and avoid making election mistakes. CIOC chairperson Jeremiah Kioni expressed concerns over staggering of  elections, saying the situation in Kenya and the mistrust that exists cannot allow for that.
