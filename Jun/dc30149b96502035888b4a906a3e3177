Lewis Njoka @LewisNjioka Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga yesterday asked Parliament to enact a law to end the monopoly of Kenya Tea Development Agency Ltd (KTDA), saying the organisation is ineffective and has failed to deliver value for the small-scale tea farmers. He said corruption, lack of transparency, conflict of interest, wrong attitude and impunity, including disobedience for court orders had become entrenched at the tea management agency, setting it on a path to collapse just like others before it. The African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development said KTDA’s top leadership had lost touch with farmers and put the country on the verge of losing its once treasured cash crop. Raila who spoke at his Capitol Hill offices after meeting directors from Kiru Tea Factory led by chairman Chege Kirundi, said there is need to open up the tea sector to competition especially in small-scale sub-sector. “The Ministry of Agriculture must embark on deliberate steps to remove cartels from this crop through greater transparency in the selling of tea and payment of farmers,” he said. Tea marketers The opposition leader said there was no need to call for disbandment of KTDA since “ineffective tea marketers  would wither naturally once the sector is opened up for competition.” He called for KTDA to be audited, saying while the agency needed to be transformed urgently, farmers felt that the current board could not transform it since some board members had served since 2000, manipulating processes to remain in office. “There is need for a forensic audit on financial management of KTDA, and all 69 KTDA-managed tea factories. Currently, KTDA is not supervised or regulated like banks, insurances or co-operatives. This must be addressed,” said Raila. The ODM party leader said Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and other agencies need to investigate activities going on at KTDA. Kirundi said KTDA’s monopoly had resulted in poor tea management.
