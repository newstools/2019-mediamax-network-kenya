George Kebaso @Morarak The Coast Development Authority (CDA) has intensified efforts to recover acres of land on coral reefs, whose degradation has affected tourism and fish stock in the Kenyan coast. Implemented under the Kenya Climate Change Adaptation Programme, funded by the Adaptation Fund, CDA has replanted 800 coral reefs in an initiative combining innovative solutions with community knowledge of the target marine ecosystem. The programme started in October last year. CDA managing director Mohamed Hassan yesterday said the health and ecological integrity of the critical marine zones has declined due to global climate change and many local stresses caused by human activities. “Over the years coral reefs have been declining at an alarming rate. They are degraded faster than they can recover and in some cases there is no recovery at all,” he said as the Africa Public Service Week came to a close yesterday at KICC.
