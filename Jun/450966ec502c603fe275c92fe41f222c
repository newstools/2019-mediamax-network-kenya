Kenya’s Ambassador to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo has hinted at having an interest in the Kitui governorship seat in 2022. The entry of the envoy in the race would complicate the political arithmetic for the incumbent Governor Charity Ngilu given that the former county boss Julius Malombe is said to have declared interest in making a comeback. Over the weekend at a burial ceremony in Nzambani location, Kilonzo criticised Ngilu’s administration which he accused of failing to address the needs of the residents regarding development. He said instead of the government revitalising water and agricultural sectors to enable the residents to maximise food production, it has prioritised unnecessary projects such as the ndengu revolution, artificial insemination of cows and honey production. “How can you tell me to start hanging beehives when I have to walk many kilometres in search of water on an empty stomach?” asked Kilonzo. Although unconfirmed reports say  the envoy is eying the son of Wiper leader Kelvin Muasya Kalonzo as runningmate, a combination that would be a blow for Ngilu given that majority of MCAs have been at longer heads with the governor, claiming that she has discriminated wards in Mwingi North, Kitui South, Kitui Rural and Kitui East. However, Ngilu has insisted that she will not be cowed by her political foes and will continue to empower residents economically.
