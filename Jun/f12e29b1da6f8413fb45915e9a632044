Washington, Wednesday Democrats in the US House of Representatives have approved $4.5 billion (Sh450 billion) in humanitarian aid for the southern border. Several migrant deaths, coupled with reports of “severely neglected” children at a Texan border patrol station, have helped shape the debate. But the bill faces a tough path through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is considering a rival bill with fewer restrictions on how border agencies can spend the money. The Democrats’ version, in contrast, contains several strict rules set out that the funds can be used for humanitarian aid only, and “not for immigration raids, not detention beds, not a border wall,” a statement from House appropriations committee chair Nita Lowey said. The bill was toughened up after Democrats expressed concern over providing extra funds for agencies involved in the current situation, including those enforcing President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy which had last year led to migrant children being separated from their parents. With the extra safeguards, it passed 230 to 195, roughly along party lines —with a few Democrats still refusing to back it. The White House said President Trump would be advised to veto the House bill if it landed on his desk “in its current form”. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy was announced in early 2018. By prosecuting adults who crossed the border illegally, it had the effect of separating children from their parents. Amid a major public outcry about the conditions facing migrant children, Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner John Sanders on Tuesday said he would be stepping down.  The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mark Morgan, is set to replace him.  -BBC
