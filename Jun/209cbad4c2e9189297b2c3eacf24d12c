Geneva, Wednesday There is “credible evidence” linking Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince to the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October, an independent UN rights expert said today, calling for an international investigation. In a fresh report, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Agnes Callamard said she had “determined that there is credible evidence, warranting further investigation of high-level Saudi officials’ individual liability, including the Crown Prince’s”. Rogue agents The report stressed that “no conclusion is made as to guilt. The only conclusion made is that there is credible evidence meriting further investigation, by a proper authority, as to whether the threshold of criminal responsibility has been met.” Callamard said for instance that she had found evidence that “Khashoggi was himself fully aware of the powers held by the Crown Prince, and fearful of him”. Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Riyadh initially said it had no knowledge of his fate, but later blamed the murder on rogue agents. Saudi prosecutors have absolved the Crown Prince and said around two dozen people implicated in the murder are in custody, with death penalties sought against five men. Callamard has been conducting what she has described as “an independent human rights inquiry” into Khashoggi’s death. Shoddy investigations UN special rapporteurs are also independent and do not speak for the world body.  In Wednesday’s report, Callamard said she found that the probes conducted so far by Saudi Arabia and Turkey had “failed to meet international standards regarding the investigation into unlawful deaths”.  -AFP
