Charles Thuku in Dar es Salaam @PeopleSports11 Kenya eased through the semi-finals of the ongoing Confederation of East and Central Africa Amputees Federation (CECAAF) in Tanzania on Wednesday night after edging out Uganda 1-0 amidst controversy over the authenticity of three of their players. Play at the National Stadium Dar-es-Salaam was stopped for 25 minutes after a suspected whistle-blower claimed that offensive midfielder Polycarp Mboya, Samson Njoroge and team captain Kevin Lumbasi, both defenders, were not full amputees and thus should not all be in the starting squad. Mboya, who is the treasurer at both Kenya Amputee Football Federation (KAFF) and CECAAF, said there was a ploy in some quarters to frustrate Kenya in outside the pitch and ensure that they do not win the cup. Reports later emerged that a Kenyan professional player was not amused after being overlooked in the final squad to Dar and acted saboteur by informing the hosts of the “anomaly” after which the report was relayed to match referees who signalled stoppage. Solved amicably However, the issue was solved amicably after it was ascertained that under the current CECAAF constitution, the three players were free to play as they had not used their lower limbs to gain undue advantage over the opposing teams as alleged. Kenya then opted to field only two such players as per the rules or continue utilising three which would have invited sanctions. On the pitch, the Kenyans struggled against Uganda amputees who have already been eliminated with Samuel Njoroge scoring the lone goal in the 45th minute following a right-wing cross from Lumbasi. Three other teams: Tanzania’s Tembo Warriors, Rwanda and Zanzibar, also qualified for the semi-finals scheduled for today. The draw was set for yesterday. In the meantime, Kenya’s coach Willis Odhiambo has said there is nothing to fear for his team after having reached the last four.
