Seth Onyango @SethManex Politicians and top government officials implicated in graft will not be allowed entry into the United States, American ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter warned yesterday. In the clearest resolve yet to help the country combat corruption, McCarter was categorical that issuance of US visa will now be based on the integrity of individuals. Speaking in an interview on Citizen TV, the diplomat stated that gone are days when thieves would make America a safe haven for their ill-gotten wealth. “We are taking a stand and we are doing everything we can within the law to deny those who have broken the law to travel to the United States. We are going to use everything in our tool box to fight this,” he said. “We are going to continue working side by side to shore up these systems of law and order,” he added. He, however, declined to issue the list of politicians implicated in corruption that have been barred from travelling to the US asserting it was illegal to disclose names. American law prohibits disclosure of names of individuals that have been denied visas in a bid to protect their privacy. This has, however, been challenged. A fortnight ago, the US promised to help Kenya combat corruption just days after the United Kingdom revealed it had deployed top sleuths in the country to help local authorities trace looted assets stashed in Britain. Fight graft The US followed suit and offered help to Kenya. Subsequently, the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti and the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji travelled to the US and held meetings with the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). A statement issued by US Embassy in Nairobi stated that their discussions will “provide the FBI and the Kenyan agencies the opportunity to enhance collaboration and mutual investigative assistance in the fight against corruption and terrorism.”
