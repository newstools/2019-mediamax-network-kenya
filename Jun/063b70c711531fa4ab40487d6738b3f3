No Kenyan professional has won the coveted ‘blue jacket’ since the inception of KCB Karen Masters in 2017. But one of the country’s finest pro golfers Greg Snow hopes to break the jinx when the crème de la crème of Sunshine Tour swing into action at the par 72 Karen Country Club tomorrow. The Muthaiga Golf Club professional is tired of living in the shadows of visiting Sunshine Tour Stars after skipping last year’s Karen Masters and missing the cut at the European Tour Magical Kenya Open earlier in the year. Missing the Kenya Open cut and a no-show at last year’s Masters saw him secure a slot for this week’s event in the recently-concluded Professional Golfers of Kenya (PGK) Road To Masters Order of Merit. Good golf “The plan is to win the event and just to have a solid week and play some good golf. I have been practising at Karen and getting ready for the week. The course is in superb lush-green conditions and I can only hope for the best.” “To set the Karen Masters ball rolling, I will go for the cut and after securing a place in the money bracket, I will definitely take the last two rounds as they come,” he said. Snow, who has previously finished in the top 10 during the Challenge Tour Kenya Open, has fond memories of the Karen course where he also finished fourth in the inaugural edition in 2017 behind Netherland’s Will Besseling who walked away with the Sh400,000 winner’s prize.
