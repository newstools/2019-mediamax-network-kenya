The government has reiterated its commitment to ensuring public universities offer quality education, even if it means closing some. While tens of jobs are at stake if the move is implemented, the government assured that no one would be punished or victimised when the process starts. According to Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, the move will see universities churn out graduates better prepared for the world’s demands. Magoha said the government wanted the country’s institutions of higher learning to be respected globally, which could only be done by looking at which universities were offering what and whether it was a priority. Changing world “We want to make sure that in the next 10 to 20 years, we will have universities that are determined to produce the demands of a changing world,” he said. “We are looking at institutions that can bring out professors who publish their works in respected journals and not private journals where you hoop in and out and get awarded, this must change,” he said. Magoha made the remarks when he opened a forum on terrorism for university registrars organised by National Counter Terrorism Centre at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha.
