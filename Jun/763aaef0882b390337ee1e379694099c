Seth Mwaniki @peopleDailyKe The inquest into the death of former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru continued yesterday with the driver of the ill-fated vehicle  Samuel Kinyanjui saying his vehicle was pushed off the road by a lorry, leading to the crash. Appearing before Senior Resident Magistrate Wendy Kagendo, he said he was trying to avoid being hit by an oncoming lorry when he swerved and hit a guard rail at Makenji. He explained that after overtaking two saloon vehicles and a lorry, he heard a loud bang forcing him to move to the inner lane of the dual carriageway. It was at this juncture Kinyanjui said that the Mercedes Benz registration number GNV 019, with four occupants among them the late governor hit the guard rail. Gakuru, 51, died in a road accident on the Nyeri -Nairobi highway on November 7, 2017. The driver, who was being cross-examined by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecution Peter Mailanyi, could not, however, explain why he opted to slow down instead of accelerating yet there was no vehicle in front. He said prior to the accident, Gakuru had twice requested to drive himself. He told the court he feared for his life, saying members of the public have a perception he was responsible for Gakuru’s death. The hearing continues.
