LEWIS NJOKA This year’s filing of tax returns has improved, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) says as it expects another last last-minute rush to beat the Sunday deadline. This year’s filing is an improvement compared to last year where only 2.2 million taxpayers had filed their returns by June 23, the taxman adds, as it expects the number to be higher by over a million compared to a similar period in 2017, where only 1.7 million people had registered. Those who have not submitted returns have only two days to do so or face penalties. As of June 23, only 2.7 million individuals and firms had filed returns out of the expected four million, signalling the possibility of a last-minute rush to beat the June 30 deadline. Failure to submit returns attracts a fine of Sh20,000 or five per cent of tax payable for the period under review, whichever is higher. However, taxpayers filing for employment income only will be fined Sh 10,000 or 25 per cent of income tax payable, whichever is higher. In a statement to newsrooms, KRA indicated all its offices, including JKIA and iTax service Centres countrywide, will remain open until June 30 to facilitate the filing. “Customs offices supporting port operations are open 24 hours to facilitate customs services whereas the iTax Service Centres will operate from 7 am to 9 pm,” it said, adding that the Contact Centre shall be operation from 6 am to midnight. “Taxpayers are also encouraged to file their tax returns from their comfort zones using iTax platform,” KRA said.
