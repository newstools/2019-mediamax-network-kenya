George Kebaso and Gloria Milimu @PeopleDailyKe Kirinyaga Governor  Anne Waiguru yesterday made good her threat to sack striking doctors on grounds that they were participating in an illegal strike. A decision to terminate the contracts was reached during a Cabinet meeting. The doctors and other medical staff who have been on strike will also not be paid their June salary. Early this month, Waiguru gave the doctors a 24-hour ultimatum to resume work or risk dismissal. To fill the gap left by the sacked medics, the county government hired 98 new health workers. “In our endeavour to ensure health services continue without further disruption, the County Executive hired 98 additional health workers,” Waiguru said. The medics downed tools five weeks ago citing delayed promotions and poor working conditions among other grievances. On Tuesday, the Laikipia county government sacked 61 striking health workers.
