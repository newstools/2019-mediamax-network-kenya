Amos Abuga @PeopleSports11 Two-time Africa high jump champion Mathew Sawe has not gotten over missing out on the 2016 Olympics and wants to atone for it by winning gold at the All Africa Games (AAG) and qualifying for the World Championships. Watched by his French coach Moussa Fall, Sawe easily qualified for the continental games scheduled for Rabat, Morocco in August during the trials at Kasarani Stadium last week and the Kenya Defence Forces athlete wants to use the event to adequately prepare for the World Championships set for Doha, Qatar in September. “I had hoped the Olympic Solidarity, an initiative started to assist all National Olympic Committees, particularly those with the greatest needs, would come to my rescue so that I make my debut at the Olympic Games but that was never to be. It was heartbreaking since I had just won the African title,” recalls Sawe, who claimed gold at the 2016 and 2018 Africa Athletics Championships. National record Sawe, who became the first Kenyan jumper to win a gold medal at a major event when he jumped 2.21m in Durban, South Africa in the 2016 edition holds the national record of 2.30m set in 2018 and has attributed his success to a change of tactics by his coach. “Since the 2018 Commonwealth Games, my growth has been steady. The way I accelerate when approaching the bar is very different than before,” said Sawe, whose previous national record was 2.25m set during the 2015 World Championship trials in Nairobi. Coach Fall, of the High Performance Training Camp in Dakar, is also encouraged by the attitude of Sawe who is motivated by missing the Olympic qualifying mark of 2.29m. “Missing the Olympics did not break him. It is spurring him to keep working towards his goal,” Fall said. “The good thing is that the talent is there and as coaches, we can only continue guiding him as his is a promising career,” he added.
