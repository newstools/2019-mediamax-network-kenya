People affected by James Gichuru-Rironi road expansion project have threatened to stop its construction over what they termed delayed and lopsided compensation. The close to 3,000 landowners and tenants yesterday accused the National Land Commission of taking them in circles and urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene because “they have run out of options”. Addressing the media at Kinoo trading centre, their chairman Kimani Njuki (pictured) said there was an urgent need to fully compensate those affected or they will forcibly stop the contractor, China Wu Yi, from working further. He claimed NLC was using tricks and coercion to make some people accept Sh54,000 as compensation, terming the amount an insult. A letter made available to the media indicated that a section of tenants had been awarded the amount but given an option of accepting or appealing against it in the Environment and Land Court. Cancel credit “How can a tenant who had a supermarket or petrol station be awarded Sh54,000 as loss of business? This is an insult and we urge President Uhuru to intervene by ordering NLC to review the awards,” said Njuki, who was flanked by hundreds of people effected by the project. Landlords said they have incurred untold losses after tenants vacated their houses close to three years ago. The affected people have also raised concerns over exclusion of some names from the Kenya Gazette, hence missing out on compensation. The Sh16.9 billion project was set to be sponsored by the World Bank. However, it withdrew from the same after the government requested it to cancel the credit for the project in December 2018 due to delays in its implementation.
