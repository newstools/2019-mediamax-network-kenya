Charles Thuku in Dar es Salaam @PeopleSport11 Kenya revived their chances of advancing in the Confederation of Amputees Football Federation (CECAAF) after edging out Zanzibar 2-0 in their second match at National Stadium in Dar es Salaam yesterday. Kenya, who lost 1-0 to Rwanda in their opening match on Sunday, played an improved game with man of the match Eugene Maganga scoring the two goals in the 19th and 36th minutes respectively. Playing with confident and vigour, Kenya put the Rwandese on the back-foot in the early moments of the match with full of running Joash Bariti releasing a screamer inside 12 minutes which forced the losers’ goalkeeper Ali Jumaa Abdallah into a spectacular save. Zanzibar, who thrived in counter attacks, then knocked in Kenya’s territory in the 21st minute, Salim Amer’s shot from Yasiri Rajabu’s pass being scrambled into safety by Kevin Lumbasi. Maganga, who was a thorn in the Zanzibaris defence, was at it again three minutes to half-time when he disentangled himself from his markers but came short of beating goalkeeper Ali Juma Abdallah from close range. Kenya is set to face hosts Tanzania today in a match anticipated to be their toughest, especially given the hosts’ sound record since the tournament kicked off on Sunday. Tanzania made a dream start by beating Rwanda 3-0 before adding the icing on the cake with a resounding 5-0 victory over Zanzibar. Kenya had endured a 16-hour journey to Dar es Salaam and was the last team to arrive in the Tanzanian capital with the effects taking toll as they struggled against the Rwandese. Kenya arrived in Dar on Saturday past 10pm and were exempted by the organisers from playing on Saturday due to fatigue. Uganda were lined up against Zanzibar in the second match of the tournament that was officially opened by Director of Sports and Development in Tanzania, Yusuf Singo.
