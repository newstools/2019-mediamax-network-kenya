Irene Githinji @gitshee Kenyans applying for renewal of their passports will be given priority in the ongoing rush to  beat September 1 deadline, Immigration Principal Secretary, Maj Gen (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa said yesterday. He said the decision has been occasioned by the fact that no person will be allowed to travel on machine readable passports after the deadline expires in September. This came as he allayed fears on the availability of material to print passports, assuring that there are more than one million e-passport booklets. Kihalangwa (pictured) said the systems in the Immigration Department were up and running, hence no need to rush since issuance of passports is a continuous process.  He also advised Kenyans planning to travel soon to submit their applications at the nearest centre with supportive evidence to enable quick processing of their passports. “The September 1, 2019 deadline for the phase out of the machine readable passports only targets current holders, who must renew them before then,” the PS said. He cautioned Kenyans to be wary of brokers taking advantage of the current situation to con them to beat the deadline.
