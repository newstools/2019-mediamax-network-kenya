Greg Snow played a good round of golf to return a five under par at the par 72 Karen Country Club to finish the day tied second at the end of the first round as Karen Masters teed off yesterday. The Muthaiga Golf Club professional, who skipped last year’s Karen Masters, started off on the right footing, shooting for a birdie on the par four, first. He followed that up with back-to-back pars before picking another birdie at the designated Hole-in-One par three, fifth. In tune, he picked another shot at the par four, sixth before dropping a shot at the par three, seventh and levelling the remaining two holes for a total of 34 out. Snow had a perfect back nine as he picked birdies at the par five, 12th and 15th and an additional third shot at the par four, 10th for a back nine total of 33 in. “I had a good round. I played solid off the tees, kept the ball in play and had some good puts. I got off to a good start with a birdie in my first hole and that gave me a bit of momentum in my first nine,” said Snow. “I had a good put in hole five and a good drive in hole six for the birdies. The only mistake of the day was hole seven but generally, I had a good round. I took advantage of the holes I knew I had to go for the flag and it paid off,” he added. David Wakhu was the second Kenyan professional on the log as he finished the round tied 12th after returning an impressive round of three under par 69. Wakhu picked birdies at the par five, third, 12th and 15th as well as at the par four 18th. He dropped a shot at the par-four ninths for the finals score. Meanwhile, hard-hitting Dismas Indiza, Jastas Madoya, Chege Wangai and Jeff Kubwa finished the first round tied at 24th after returning a round of two under par 70. Sujan Shah played for a total of 71 while Simon Ngige and Richard Ainley levelled the course.
