A man from Kiharu, Murang’a county is nursing serious injuries after neighbours allegedly mutilated his genitals and left him with burns on his body over claims he stole their goats. James Mwangi claims to have been summoned out of his house at night a fortnight ago by two people who said they wanted to have a discussion with him. At the door, he was accosted by two other men, said to be brothers. “One of them was holding a gun and he instructed me to follow them to their home where they ordered that I take off my pants,” he said. The two then assaulted him demanding to know why he had stolen the goats. “They beat me with a red hot panga on my back and one squeezed my private parts between a pair of pliers,” he said, adding that his cries and fervent denials fell on deaf ears. Stood ground “I stood my ground and told them I had nothing to do with their missing goats and told them if they think I am involved, they should take me to the police,” he said. They reportedly refused and continued to beat him up before letting him go. “They told me they want to do things ‘mungiki style’ and they do not want to involve the police,” he said. Mwangi went to Murang’a General Hospital the following day and secured a P3 Form.  His efforts to seek justice have, however, hit a snag. “The police told me to withdraw the case as those who had assaulted me want the matter settled outside the court. I was told to look for the two and we set a date, which we can meet, but I fear this could just be a way of sweeping the matter under the carpet,” he said. Mwangi’s wife Rose Wanjiru said her husband is in untold pain. “He has a lot of pain while passing urine and prefers to stay on his feet as sitting down is impossible,” she said. Murang’a County Police Commander Josphat Kinyua said he has forwarded the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for further action.
