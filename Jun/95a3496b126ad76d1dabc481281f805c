He is a good young man who can contribute to national development,” said Bera. He first reported at Kileleshwa Police Station where the son was initially booked after the State House intrusion incident before proceeding to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) where he is admitted under police guard. Condition history “I saw him but we did not talk much. I was really hurt,” Bera narrated. At KNH, hospital management only allowed Kibet’s relative to visit him in the general ward.

Consequently, when he went back to school, officers at Naro Moru Police Station arrested him for trying to climb Mt Kenya. He was locked up for two days before his father was contacted and allowed to take him to a psychiatrist in Nairobi.
