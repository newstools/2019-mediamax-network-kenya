Despite strides made in counties towards improvement of health, irregular disbursement of funds and a series of strikes by health workers has undermined the sector. Council of Governors (CoG) chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said Friday that financing of the sector has also not reached the minimum recommended proportion of the national budget of 15 percent prescribed in the Abuja Declaration of 2001. Challenges notwithstanding, Oparanya said in the State of Devolution Address (SODA) in Nairobi that counties are committed to strengthening health systems towards the implementation of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). President Uhuru Kenyatta launched piloting for UHC in three counties namely Nyeri, Machakos, Kisumu and Isiolo. Key among the highlights of the sector in counties included sustained an average allocation of 20-30 percent in the year. “Currently we have 7,894 doctors, 26,561 nurses, 160 dental officers, 418 pharmacists and 19,000 clinical officers across the Counties. However a total of 834 doctors are on study leave, thereby unavailable to offer services. This remains a challenge counties have to balance between training and workforce availability,” said Oparanya Functional health facilities grew from 9,858 to 10,820 in 2018 across all counties. Saying vaccination is a main component of preventive medicare, Oparanya noted that in the last one year, counties have witnessed 18.1 percent increase in pentavalent vaccine uptake translating to over 1.2 million vaccinations in 2018. Concerted efforts in the management of immunisation programmes by both levels of government have seen an increase in immunisation coverage for infants to 81.6 percent last year from 68.4 percent in 2017. He attributed this to availability of commodity and supplies and improved human resources for health.
