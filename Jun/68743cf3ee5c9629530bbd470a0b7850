Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi The rift in Jubilee Party continues to widen, with Deputy President William Ruto’s supporters in the North Rift saying they will  no longer remit monthly contributions to the party. Speaking at Keburo area in Aldai constituency on Monday, the legislators resolved to withhold their contributions to the party to protest what they termed as schemes by party insiders to scuttle Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Nandi Senator Samson Cheragei said they would not watch as  Ruto’s plans were being frustrated by people within the party. “We have resolved that as North Rift leaders, we will no longer remit our monthly contributions to Jubilee Party because of the mistreatment that is being meted out on the DP by party insiders,” he said. Alternative vehicle The outspoken Senator hinted that Ruto’s allies may consider shopping for an alternative political vehicle for his presidential run. “It is no longer tenable to stay in Jubilee Party unless the secretary general Raphael Tuju is edged out for being part of a cartel out to frustrate DP’s 2022 succession plans,” said Cherargei. Aldai MP Cornel Serem accused Tuju of working with Ruto’s opponents. “There is no way we can trust Tuju because he is part of the people plotting to block Ruto from ascending to the presidency,” said Serem. Other MPs who spoke at the meeting were Wilson Kogo, (Chesumei), Vincent Tuwei (Mosop), Julius Melly (Tinderet ) and Decla Tum (Nandi Woman Rep). Speaking at a separate function, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi told Tuju to resign from the party position or be ejected by members. “We are giving him 24 hours to tender his resignation failure to which we will kick him out of the party,” Sudi said at Wareng High School during a sports event. Kesses MP Swarup Mishra asked leaders to avoid acts that can trigger animosity in the region.
