Shawn Osimbo in Cairo @PeopleSports11 Harambee Stars French coach Sebastien Migne has admitted that his side were afraid to take the battle to Algeria during their Group C opener on Sunday night at the June 30 stadium in Cairo. Kenya was making a return to the continental show piece for the first time in 15 years and had hoped for at least a point from the fixture as they seek to progress beyond the group stage for the first time in the history of the competition, but lost their opening match 2-0. Migne said after the match that Kenya lacked the experience to match the Desert Foxes and suffered from stage fright as they succumbed to two first-half goals. He said he was disappointed with his team’s slow start, a position from which they never recovered. Afraid and unfortunately “We were afraid and unfortunately we did not play. I don’t mind losing but not like this. I didn’t recognise my team at the beginning,” he said. “If you’re afraid it’s not possible to exist in this kind of tournament,” he said. He added: “We missed experience in this kind of tournament. We had too much pressure today because of Algeria’s quality. If you’re afraid, it’s impossible to exist at Afcon.” Manchester City star Riyad Mahrez scored as an untroubled Algeria cruised to victory over Star. Regular underachievers Algeria have lifted the trophy just once, on home soil in 1990, but are among a group of potential contenders in Egypt and will look to former African footballer of the year Mahrez for inspiration. Prolific striker Baghdad Bounedjah fired Algeria ahead from the penalty spot on 34 minutes and Mahrez turned in a second before half-time in the second match of a Group C doubleheader at the 30 June Stadium. A highly-fancied Senegal beat Tanzania 2-0 in the earlier game. It is almost a decade since Algeria last made an impact, reaching the 2010 semi-finals, and the north African conditions will suit a squad capable of going far.
