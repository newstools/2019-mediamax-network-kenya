Irene Githinji and Lydiah Nyanchwa @PeopleDailyKe Education Cabinet secretary Prof George Magoha yesterday called for extra vigilance in schools, in the wake of reported indiscipline cases in some schools. Magoha said a systematic focus on the students has to be taken, even as he directed that education officials keenly monitor what goes on in schools in their jurisdiction. The CS told regional directors of education (RDEs) and county directors of education if indiscipline cases are reported in their areas of jurisdiction, they will have failed in their mandate. Consequently, the officers are expected to monitor schools at least once every two weeks. “We do not want to hear schools were burned down at prep time because it means someone somewhere was not doing their job or if it is sabotage, the field commander is supposed to know,” he said. The CS asked for names of teachers, who have gone out of their way to thwart cases of indiscipline in the last few days, saying they should be celebrated for being vigilant. Education Principal secretary Belio Kipsang asked  RDEs to hold frequent meetings with field officers at the county level to address indiscipline cases. The two spoke yesterday at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Nairobi, when they met with education stakeholders to discuss examination preparedness.
