Alexandria, Thursday @PeopleSports11 It was a pulsating match at the Alexandria Stadium as Madagascar triumphed for a historic first ever Africa Cup of Nations victory with a 1-0 win over Burundi at the Alexandria Stadium on Thursday. The first-half offered plenty of attacking action as both sides fought tooth and nail, but the goalkeepers were on form to keep the scores goalless at half-time. Burundi came out with intent after the restart, but Madagascar produced the moment of magic to seal three points after Marco Ilaimaharitra rifled home a scintillating free kick. The result places Madagascar second in Group B with four points just behind Nigeria who have won two out of two. Saido subdued Once tipped to become an England regular during his formative West Bromwich Albion days, Saido Berahino is now captain of Burundi, leading the Swallows to their first-ever appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations. Unfortunately, the now-free agent failed to really impose the authority on the match, posing an isolated figure up top as the Madagascar defence nullified his attacking presence.                       -AGENCIES
