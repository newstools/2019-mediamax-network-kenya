Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu County Assemblies Forum (CAF) has sounded the alarm over growing levels of deductions from county staff, amounting to Sh47 billion, unremitted to County pension schemes. Addressing stakeholders during the County Pension Fund (CPF) Annual General Meeting in Mombasa, CAF Chairman Roba Duba said there was a danger of the pending dues ending up being forgotten, thereby jeopardising the future of retiring county staff. He asked Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA) to take responsibility to shield the County staff against the impending dangers of plunging into retirement crisis. “I also want to appeal to the Council of Governors to push to the bitter end and ensure this money is recovered,” he said. Hosea Kili, CPF Chief Executive Officer raised concern over low pension coverage, huge funds unremitted to pension schemes and unfavourable regulatory regime, saying they continue to undermine business. Impressive growth He, however, said the above challenges notwithstanding, the fund recorded an impressive growth last year with increased assets and membership. Kili told the meeting that in 2018 the fund value grew to Sh27.65 billion up from Sh26.5 billion in 2017. The scheme also realised an increase in the overall return on investment to Sh2.1 billion during the period up from Sh1.4 billion in 2016. Devolution Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa said public policy must be reviewed to enable retirement benefit schemes to support government projects such as Big Four agenda. “Pension schemes have contributed immensely to development. Retirement benefits funds are preferable because they tend to be available for the long term,” he added. The CS hailed CPF for its performance despite a tough financial year characterised by a general subdued performance in the financial sector.
