London, Monday Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson to become Britain’s next prime minister, on Monday called on his rival not to be “a coward” trying to “avoid scrutiny” over both a domestic row and his policy agenda. Foreign minister Hunt urged Johnson, who has become embroiled in a scandal over a dispute with his girlfriend that led to a police visit last week, to “man up” and show he can cope with questioning. Johnson, the overwhelming favourite to replace Theresa May as Conservative Party leader, and therefore prime minister, has refused to discuss the early Friday incident. He has also kept an unusually low profile during the weeks-old race, skipping a candidates’ TV debate and doing barely any media interviews. “I am not interested in debating Boris’s private life,” Hunt said in an article in The Times, arguing he instead wants to quiz Johnson on his Brexit plans and other ideas. “A new prime minister needs the legitimacy of having made his arguments publicly and having them subjected to scrutiny,” he said. “Only then can you walk through the front door of No 10 with your head held high instead of slinking through the back door, which is what Boris appears to want,” Hunt added. Urging Johnson to attend a TV debate proposed for Tuesday evening, Hunt added: “Don’t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.” – AFP
