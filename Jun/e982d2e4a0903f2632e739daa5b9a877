Software Group, a global technology company specialised in digitisation and integration solutions for financial services institutions with African operations run from Kenya, has appointed Connor Hanan as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Prior to his appointment, Hanan was the company’s Key Global Accounts manager. He has had a successful career focused on financial services specific to affordable shelter in developing contexts. Within this sector he helped establish operations, small businesses and partnerships across roughly 35 markets in Africa, Europe, Central Asia and Middle East. As the region CEO, he will oversee Africa’s operations and sales and manage the Kenya and Ghana teams of over 60 employees. Currently, Software Group works with more than 65 clients in Africa including banks, insurance companies, microfinance institutions and Saccos. “The African financial ecosystem is a place of constant change; new frontiers of opportunity are being identified and rapidly accessed. It is no longer appropriate to think only of delivery channels for market penetration — one must be agile and strategic,” Hanan said. Software Group focuses on providing an Omni-Channel digital banking platform, which not only gets products into the digital marketplace through cutting-edge channels, but provides a strategic platform that allows for the innovation and agility required for a continuous competitive edge. It currently serves a worldwide client base in more than 70 countries from 9 regional offices located in Australia, Bulgaria, Egypt, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mexico, the Philippines and the USA.
