Lisbon, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 England’s long wait for a first international trophy since 1966 could be just days away at the Nations League finals in Portugal, but Ronald Koeman’s resurgent Netherlands present a hazardous hurdle for the Three Lions in Thursday’s semi-final in Guimaraes. A run to the semi-finals of last year’s World Cup and memorable victories over Spain and Croatia to make the last four of another tournament within 12 months have raised expectations that Gareth Southgate in coaching the generation to finally end England’s wait for glory. By contrast, the Dutch have had a lean few years after failing to make it to Russia last year or qualify for Euro 2016. Even though the Dutch lost a thrilling opening Euro 2000 qualifier 3-2 to Germany in March there are no fears they will miss out for a third consecutive major tournament. The side captained by the imperious Virgil van Dijk is also blessed with the core of an Ajax side that were seconds away from facing Van Dijk’s Liverpool in the Champions League final. Tottenham robbed the Eredivisie of its first Champions League finalist since 1996 with a dramatic late semi-final, second leg winner in Amsterdam as the Premier League dominated European competition this season. But there is no guarantee English success will carry over to the international stage. Indeed, there were as many Dutchman as English players in Liverpool’s starting line-up as they lifted the European Cup on Saturday with Van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum. One of Koeman’s first acts when taking charge of his country last year was to make Van Dijk his skipper having worked with him at Southampton. “When you look at Virgil now, this is a big, big personality on the pitch. He is a leader,” Koeman told The Guardian. “That is why I made him captain. I knew him from Southampton. I thought: “he can do more –he can carry more responsibility. He is strong; he has a great character and enjoys the responsibility.”                        -AFP
