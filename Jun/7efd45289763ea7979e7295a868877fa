Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Residents of Mountain View estate in Nairobi have threatened to go to court over the redesign of James Gichuru-Rironi highway, which they say is inconveniencing them. The residents say they are spending long hours to access Nairobi city centre following construction works along the Waiyaki Way section. Mountain View Estate Residents Association (Mvera) has twice written to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to protest the changes around Kangemi market resulting from the ongoing construction of James Gichuru-Rironi road. Their complaints, they claim, have fallen on deaf ears despite the 25km project having affected over 100,000 commuters in the larger Kangemi area. Mvera argues that about 4,000 residents of the estate have had the usual U-turn  to the city centre stretched an extra five kilometres at Uthiru interchange. In their first letter to KeNHA dated January 11, this year, the residents said  the original U-turn at Thiong’o Road has been disregarded by a large distance. They said the estate was not consulted. “This is a very serious omission by KeNHA officials,” the letter reads in part. KeNHA’s response on February 4 insists that Waiyaki Way is a Class A restricted highway without U turns. The agency further dispels claims that the added distance will lower the value of the estate.
