Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu A day after Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua raised concern over the neglect of Tom Mboya and Dedan Kimathi statues in Nairobi, their sculptor Oshoto Ondula has claimed that the government owes him Sh4.5 million for one of the monuments. In an interview with People Daily in Diani yesterday, Ondula said Governor Mutua’s concerns were spot on but the government “must clear the pending amount before refurbishment of the statues can start”. “I was commissioned to sculpt Tom Mboya and Ronald Ngala monuments. The Culture ministry has never completed paying for the former. They still owe me Sh4.5 million,” he said. On the negligence surrounding the site, he said the blame squarely lies on the ministry. Yesterday Nairobi county workers were sighted sprucing up Dedan Kimathi and Tom Mboya statutes.
