Amos Abuga @PeopleSport11 Charles Yosei Muneria and Beatrice Mutai are some of the elite runners who will compete in the inaugural Co-operative Alliance of Kenya (CAK) Ushirika road race at Uhuru Park on Sunday. Muneria, who clinched the only silver medal for Kenya in the men’s half marathon in the inaugural Africa Beach Games in Sal, Cape Verde last week and Mutai, second in the 2019 National Cross-Country Championships, will take part in the 10km category. The event will comprise the 10km elite race, 7km main race, 5km CEO’s run and 2km race for children with the winners in the elite category pocketing Sh100,000. Speaking during the pre-race briefing yesterday, CAK Chief Operating Officer Steve Otieno said their target is to raise not less than Sh50 million which will assist needy students to not only achieve basic education but also support their social life. “The need for learners to access formal education is still a challenge and despite numerous efforts to address this issue, the gap has continued to widen. This has propelled us as cooperative societies to come up with a way to support additional learners,” said Otieno. Otieno also disclosed plans to spread the initiative to every county since they boast close to 22,000 co-operative societies across the country. CAK CEO David Marube said the event will culminate in the International Co-operatives Day celebrations planned for July 6 in 46 counties with the unveiling of the proceeds to the learners slated for December 11.
