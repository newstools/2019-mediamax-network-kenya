Mercy Mwai and  Zadock Angira @PeopleDailyKe The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji yesterday said the US’ Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) was invited to probe assassination claims by Deputy President William Ruto to avoid claims of bias. Haji said FBI will help establish the author of an unauthenticated a letter alleging four Cabinet Secretaries are plotting to assassinate Ruto. Haji told MPs that his office had resolved to involve the US domestic intelligence and security service in the investigations to eliminate any claims of bias and political connotations that may be dragged into the inquiry. Appearing before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, Haji said the intention is to ensure the probe is above board. “We have been accused before of bias in our work. We decided to involve an independent body to carry out the investigations and report who authored the letter and the origin of the assassination claims,” he said. Foreign agency Haji was responding to nominated MP Jeniffer Shamalla who asked why a foreign agency was invited to undertake the probe. According to Haji, FBI is better equipped with skills and expertise to undertake an independent investigation on the allegations. “We will get an independent report so that we are not accused of dishonesty,” added Haji. Whereas Ruto had insisted that he can give his statement to the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, the latter is said to have declined to avoid complicating the matter further. “The DP has in the past criticised the DCI in his work. It would be unfair for them to handle the matter of that nature given it is touching on claims of murder,” said a senior official aware of the developments. The officer cited the alleged Sh21 billion Kimwarer and Arror dams scam probe in which Ruto and his allies accused the DCI of politicising the investigations.
