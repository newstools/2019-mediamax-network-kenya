Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) management is on the spot over misappropriation of funds. In a report tabled in the National Assembly by Leader of Majority Aden Duale yesterday, Auditor General Edward Ouko raised concern over various issues including failure to claim ownership of land, medical services contract loses, long outstanding dues, non-compliance with National Cohesion and Integration Act. In particular, Ouko raised the red flag over the payment of Sh15.6 million relating to security investigations expenses in respect to meal allowances paid to the hospital security officers for the year ended June 30. Ouko said the hospital made the payment yet they were working as required. “No explanation has been provided for paying security officers meal allowances for working in their duty stations. Under the circumstances, the accuracy and propriety of security investigation expenses of Sh15.6 million could not be confirmed,” read the report. Consequently, Ouko also raised concern over the hospital’s move to ignore a recommendation of a parliamentary committee to recover four parcels of land valued at Sh50 million. The Public Investment Committee (PIC) in its 19th report recommended that the National LandCommission revokes the title deeds irregularly issued to private entities, Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC) investigates how the hospital land was allocated to individuals and that the former hospital Chief Executive Officer be surcharged for any loss that may have been incurred.
