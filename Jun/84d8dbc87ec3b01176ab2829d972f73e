The Head of State made the remarks as he underscored the importance of an effective public service to achieve sustainable development. Uhuru, who spoke when he addressed the 7th Africa Public Service Day at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), said Africa is on the rise but needs bold and transformative leadership to keep it on the trajectory of growth. He said African governments need to be supported by a diligent, well-motivated and professional public service to enable national and individual prosperity, adding that the workforce must have integrity. “This monumental task calls for unyielding commitment, clear and coherent vision, bold transformative leadership and above all else, promotion of integrity and working hard culture,” the said.
