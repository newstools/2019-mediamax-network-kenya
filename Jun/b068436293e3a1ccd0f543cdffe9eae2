Madrid, Sunday A first trophy in seven years for Liverpool, and a first win in seven finals for Jurgen Klopp. The European Cup is heading back to Anfield for the sixth time and their manager is confident there is much more to come. A beaming Klopp revealed after Saturday’s 2-0 final victory over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid that he had received a congratulatory phonecall from Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola. Three weeks ago, the Reds were denied a first league title in 30 years by City, despite losing just once and racking up 97 points, but winning the Champions League makes up for that disappointment.“We promised each other already that we will kick our butts next year again. We will go for everything and we’ll see if we get something,” Klopp said of his brief exchange with Guardiola in between speaking to the world’s media at the Metropolitano Stadium. It was a sentiment shared by centre-back Virgil van Dijk as he spoke after being named man of the match in the final. Every trophy “In July when we start again, everyone starts on nil and everyone’s working towards their goals. Obviously we want to challenge for every trophy if possible,” he declared. Liverpool had won nothing at all since defeating Cardiff City on penalties in the League Cup final in 2012. A trophy, but not on the same level as this. After losing the Europa League final in 2016 and last year’s Champions League final against Real Madrid, Liverpool seized their chance this time thanks to Mohamed Salah’s early penalty and Divock Origi’s late strike. This was already a club reborn under the German’s management, but such a tangible reward was needed, three and a half years on from his arrival on Merseyside.                          -AFP
