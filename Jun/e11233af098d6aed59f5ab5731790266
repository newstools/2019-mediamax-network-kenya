Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC)  assets risk auction if its management fails to pay suppliers Sh390 million emanating from the World Trade Organisations (WTO) conference and other claims. Auditor General Edward Ouko has warned that KICC would lose the money if it fails to pay the pending bills before the end of the current financial year. According to a special audit report tabled before the National Assembly, he said that the claimants have valid contracts, Local Purchase Orders (LPO), Local Service Orders (LSO), award letters and delivery of goods, services and confirmation of works done and thus ought to be paid their dues. The pending bills initially stood at Sh1.1 billion, but after the special audit, Ouko scaled it down to Sh390 million, which he recommended that it be paid to avoid subjecting the management to court awards in delayed payments. Valid contracts Out of the Sh390 million, WTO project claims stands at Sh175.5 million while non-WTO claims stand at Sh211 million. “We recommend payment of various contractors, suppliers and service providers. The corporation risks its assets being attached in the event that the claims are not settled as most claimants have contracts,” he said. The push for the payment comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta while leading the country in commemorating the 56th Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok on June1, directed that all pending bills be cleared before end of the current financial year.
