CAPE TOWN, The 16th Table Mountain Challenge (TMC), a 44-km trail run clockwise around the mountain, took place with much fanfare on Sunday with the sponsorship of China Construction Bank.
More than 600 runners from South Africa and other countries took part in the annual race which consisted mostly of single track with a few kilometers of jeep track.
The trail involved a lot of scrambling, passing through indigenous forest and crossing mountain streams, steep slopes of fynbos and views.
David Grier, one of South Africa’s greatest runners who has run the Great Wall of China twice, took part in the event, together with his running partner Andrew Stewart, for the seventh time to raise funds for his charity foundation Miles for Smiles.
Kane Reilly won the men’s race in 4:30:56, and Landi Greyling led the women’s race in 5:49:59. Both are South African.
Luo Meiwei, general manager of China Construction Bank Johannesburg Branch, said that the bank sponsored the event to spread the message of building a better future.
Luo said China Construction Bank always supports efforts to promote people’s health, develop low-carbon economy and contribute to charity.
The TMC conforms with the bank’s idea, and China Construction Bank will sponsor the TMC for five consecutive years, Luo said.
Cape Town mayor Dan Plato lauded China Construction Bank for making contributions to the South African economy and doing a lot of good things for local communities.  (Xinhua)
