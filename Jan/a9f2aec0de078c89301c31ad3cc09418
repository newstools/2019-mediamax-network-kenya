KCB Group, the biggest bank by assets, is looking to bolster growth by joining a wave of consolidation in the country’s banking industry in the next few years, its chief executive said on Monday. Kenyan banks are moving to consolidate in response to a 2016 cap on commercial lending rates and tougher central bank regulations which followed the collapse of three banks in 2015-2016. “The next frontier for growth for us in the market will be inorganic growth because ultimately it is about taking market share,” Joshua Oigara told Reuters in an interview without giving details. “The industry will continue to consolidate.” The government, keen on strengthening the country’s banking sector, in December welcomed merger talks between NIC bank and Commercial Bank of Africa. In 2017, Diamond Trust Bank bought Habib Kenya. Consolidation has been spurred partly by the government’s introduction of the cap on commercial lending rates in 2016, designed to help small businesses access money at affordable rates. But the cap has made banks more cautious about lending to small enterprises because they say it is more difficult to assess risk. Oigara said bankers were still engaging with lawmakers on the future of the rate cap, which has led to a steep drop in private sector credit growth as banks cut credit to small borrowers deemed too risky. –REUTERS
