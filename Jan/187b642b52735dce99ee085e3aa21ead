David Macharia @PeopleSport11 Athletics Kenya has banned coaches who are not teachers from withdrawing children from school to take part in non-school athletics competitions. AK national treasurer David Miano said the move is meant to protect the youth and keep them in school with non-teachers now not allowed to accompany any Under-18 runner to any competition including the forth coming national cross-country set for February 23 in Eldoret. Subsequently, junior athletes going for competitions have to be under a teacher, in particular a female, if it is a girls’ team. “From today keep off students. This is one of the red lines you are not supposed to cross. If you do, you will be arrested and charged,” Miano told coaches in a day long meeting at Olympia Hotel in Nyahururu on Monday. Miano said the Ministry of Education is perturbed by reports that children are being withdrawn from school to pursue athletics while also revealing that AK has written to the Japanese embassy in Nairobi, saying no junior athlete should be given a visa to travel to the Far East country without express authority from the ministry and the federation. The revelation was a shock to some coaches at the meeting who had already finalised travel plans for junior runners to Japan. Miano asked them to seek authority from the Education Ministry first. In a bid to up the war against doping, AK has also written to embassies of several nations urging them to thoroughly check Kenyan athletes who travel to to their countries. “This is because we are being entangled in doping cases that happened in other countries,” added Miano.
