The newly-refurbished multi-billion shillings Kenya Breweries Ltd (KBL) plant in Kisumu is on schedule for launch mid this year. According to KBL managing director Jane Karuku, the Kisumu brewery is expected to be up and running for the production of Senator Keg in about six months as per the standard timeline for setting up a brewery. Karuku said the plant launch is expected to take place once ongoing final touches in construction and testing of the systems are completed. “We are in the last mile of the project. But as per the specifications of establishing a brewery we still have about six months remaining in the plans,” she said during an inspection tour of the plant on Tuesday ahead of the launch. The process, she said, takes an average of 24 months. Initially, the Sh15 billion plant, whose ground-breaking ceremony was presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017, was to begin production in July last year.
