Geneva,Tuesday Over 30,000 people fled the Nigerian town of Rann and across the border to Cameroon over the weekend amid fears of renewed attacks by Boko Haram militia men, the UN said Tuesday. “All the population seems to be panicking and they are on the run as a preemptive measure to save their lives,” UN refugee agency spokesman Babar Baloch said in Geneva. Rann, near the border with Cameroon in northern Borno state, already saw an exodus of some 9,000 people earlier this month after a Boko Haram attack on January 14 left 14 people dead. Baloch said that Cameroon had sent back the 9,000 refugees and had initially sent in troops that are part of a multinational taskforce to protect the town. “It was a bit peaceful, but as far as we understand now, that multinational taskforce has left,” he said. Refugees had told aid workers that Boko Haram militants had “promised to return to Rann,” he said, explaining the panic. -AFP
