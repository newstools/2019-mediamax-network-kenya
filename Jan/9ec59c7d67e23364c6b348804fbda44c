Ushuru produced a complete performance to maintain top spot in the National Super League following a 2-0 win over Bidco United 2-0 at Ruaraka grounds yesterday. Goals from forward Oscar Mbugua in the first minute and Brian Yahama in the 34th minute were enough to restore order for the taxmen following their unlikely goalless draw away to Nairobi Stima last weekend. Their victory pushes them to 29 points in the standings without a loss and in prime position to close the first leg strongly. The league leaders started the match strongly, putting their opponents on the back foot for most of the game. Lively Edwin Mwaura was a threat while the midfield pairing of Patrick Macharia and Barack Odhiambo worked tirelessly to inject purpose upfront. Mbugua was excellently put through following a quick start by Macharia who turned in his defender before firing a low right shot past stranded Bidco custodian Daniel Guoma who had little time in arranging his defence. The second goal for Ushuru came after a neat one-two between Odhiambo and Ken Sunga released deadly Yamaha who mazed his way through the Bidco backline before lobbing nicely past Guoma. After the match, Ushuru tactician Ken Kenyatta praised his charges for a good show, saying: “We pick each game at a time so we are happy with the points. It is always important to win and keep the consistency going,” said Kenyatta. Elsewhere, AP beat visiting St Joseph’s 1-0 at Camp Toyoyo grounds while fourth-placed Kisumu Allstars drew 1-1 against hosts Eldoret Youth. There was a goal fest in the match between Kibera Black Stars and Kenya Police who tied 3-3 with the former yet to get a win this campaign. Nairobi Stima on their part had Eric Kinuthia to thank for the lone goal they scored against FC Talanta to move them to third on the table.
