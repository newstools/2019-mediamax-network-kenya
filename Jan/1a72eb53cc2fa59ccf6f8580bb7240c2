Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has issued a blanket ban against civilians wearing clothes that resemble police or military attire, and has ordered  the arrest of anyone, who will flout the directive. He said  criminals masquerading as security officers have been terrorising members of the public, prompting the ban. “Our attention has been drawn to the growing tendency by some persons to don attire resembling police or military uniforms, which is creating confusion amongst members of the public as to who is a genuine member of any of our security agencies,” he said, adding that the order is aimed at improving security.Some Mombasa traders have, however, lamented they will bear losses as they had imported the clothes for sale.
