Kenya Sevens surpassed expectations when they picked seven points from the third leg of the 2018/19 World Rugby Sevens Series in Hamilton, New Zealand. Shujaa coach Paul Murunga had named five debutants in the squad for Hamilton and Sydney legs and having seen other novices struggle to impress in the opening legs in Dubai and Cape Town where they picked four point from the two rounds, little was expected from the side. However, Kenya put up a spirited fight, registering their first win by beating France 19-12 after narrow wins to South Africa and Scotland in the group stages. That earned them a third place in the group where they subsequently dropped to the Challenge Trophy to meet Tonga in the quarter-final yesterday. They kicked off their day on a high, beating Tonga 19-12 with tries from Johnstone Olindi and Jacob Ojee with the former converting two of the three tries to book a semi-final date with Argentina whom they beat 24-7. Ojee dotted down twice, Cyprian Kuto and Daniel Taabu added the other two tries with the latter managing to convert two of the four tries as a solid Shujaa sailed to the finals. However, the brave young Shujaa came up against heavyweights England in the final and the difference in class and experience was laid bare when they lost 36-7. It was a brave fight though as Kenya managed a converted try courtesy of Vincent Onyala to exit the tournament with seven points for a total tally of 11 in the opening three legs which sees them move to 13th place on the 16-table ahead of the fourth leg in Sydney, Australia this weekend. That impressive performance saw Kenya earn a favourable draw for the Sydney leg where they will take on beaten Hamilton finalists USA, Canada and France in Pool B. If Kenya can summon the same zeal and determination in Australia as they did on New Zealand, then they have a chance against Canada and France, who they beat last weekend, and book a first Cup quarter-final appearance of the season.
