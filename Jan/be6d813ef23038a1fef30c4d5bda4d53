Teresa Ombiti @PeopleDailyKe Hawkers in Mombasa have asked the county government to adopt a car-free days policy similar to that proposed for Nairobi county to allow small traders sell their wares. This follows Monday’s announcement by Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia that the government would be closing roads for two days every week to give space for hawkers to run their businesses in the streets of the Capital city. Mombasa Hawkers Chairman Hamisi Dawa, said similar policies are in place in many countries across the world and have created jobs for many people. He asked Governor Hassan Joho to consider closing roads such asBiashara Street, Msanifu Kombo and Haile Selassie for some hours to promote small traders. He said hawking business could help county generate the much needed revenue for the development of the country. “The county government should adopt similar policy here in Mombasa,” said Dawa. Another hawker Sadick Akili said that the county has neglected hawkers who were chased from the streets of Mombasa when his administration came to office. “Mombasa county should also adopt innovative ideas of encouraging small businesses to grow,” he said. The government has announced that Nairobi will be car-free on Wednesdays and Saturdays starting February 1. Transport Principal Secretary Paul Maringa on Monday said there will be dedicated parking in Uhuru Park and Railways as no car will be allowed within the central business district during these two days. Maringa said during the set days, hawkers will be allowed to sell their wares. The PS said this will generate Sh39.5 million daily revenue to the government from over 100,000 hawkers.
