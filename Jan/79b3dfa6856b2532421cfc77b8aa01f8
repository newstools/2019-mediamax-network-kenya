Some Kiambu youths have  criticised Governor Ferdinand Waititu for alleged involvement in Nairobi county affairs. Waititu recently criticised  his Nairobi counterpart Mike Sonko over the introduction of Bus Rapid Transport (BRT), saying the decisions he has been making in the public transport sector will hurt masses, who use matatus daily. Kiambu Young Professional Association claimed Waititu had abandoned them on development matters, yet he is engaged in Nairobi’s governance. They cited dilapidated roads and drugs shortage in hospitals. “We want Waititu  to start projects that will empower us,” said a youth.
