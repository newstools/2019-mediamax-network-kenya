Brian Musyoka @PeopleDailyKe Embu University has signed a memorandum of understanding with Biotechnology Programme Trust (TBPT) to partner in extending research and preservation of a variety of indigenous trees. While signing the deal, TBPT director Dr Benson Kanyi said the partnership brings a wealth of experience and knowledge from the university in research and use of readily available research laboratories in fact-finding and cloning of trees. “The partnership will enable us do a thorough research and develop hybrid seedlings which we will introduce to the environment,’’ he said. Kanyi said TBPT has collaborated with other institutions of learning abroad and locally in areas of research and technology to come up with the best species of trees. Embu University Vice Chancellor Prof Daniel Mugendi said the move to collaborate with the TBPT will help the university achieve its mandate in research and science and will also pave way for the university to ask for grants to boost the research.
