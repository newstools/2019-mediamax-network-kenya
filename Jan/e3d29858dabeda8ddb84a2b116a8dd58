Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, who attended the burial, said the country’s security system is alert to keep attacks of any kind at bay. Matiang’i said 10 suspects have been arrested in connection to the attack, adding that no criminal would be allowed to live peacefully in the country. “We will pursue you and punish you mercilessly,” he said. Boinnet (pictured) said security agencies will not relent in the fight against terror and other  crimes. “Our presence here is a testimony of our resilience as a force. We will stand firm in securing our country,” he said.
