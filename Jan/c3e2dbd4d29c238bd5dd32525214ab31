Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Former chairman of the defunct Transition Authority Kinuthia Wamwangi has spelt doom for police officers in public transport business if he is appointed chairman of the National Police  Service Commission (NPSC). Wamwangi yesterday told the Public Service Commission  (PSC) interviewing panel that although the matter is a policy issue after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the enactment of law barring the same, he will issue a blanket ban to all officers’ involvement in the businesses, if he sails through. “I have given 20 policy recommendations to the panel against which I want to be judged once I become the commission chairman,” he said. He cited the need to digitise police records including the Occurence Book and performance management system. Retired Justice Joyce Alouch said she is equal to the task of  reforming NPSC. “I am a very firm person. I have always made very objective and impartial decisions,” she said. Lucy Karuru, a conflict management and peace building expert,  and former IEBC commissioner Albert Bwire were also interviewed for the job. On Monday, Kenneth Marende, Elijah Kodoh and Lucy Wanja, among others, faced the panel, which will conduct interviews until Friday.
