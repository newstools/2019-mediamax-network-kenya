Swamibapa showed all round supremacy by downing rivals Stray Lions by four wickets in a Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association T20 clash at the weekend. The Super Division match, held at Jamhuri High School on Sunday, saw Swami win the toss and select to bat in the opening innings. They set a commendable target of 173/6 in their allotted overs before the Lions attempted an unsuccessful chase after the break to reach only 123 all out on the board inside 18.3 overs. Opening batsman Irfan Karim (61 off 33 balls) was the top run getter for Swamibapa with his contribution including seven boundaries and four sixes. Mitesh Sanghani (45 off 34 balls) came off middle order to shore the numbers after the quick dismissals of regulars Alex Obanda (24 off 13 balls) and Maurice Ouma (2 off 07 balls). Both were trapped leg before wicket by the impressive Shem Ngoche whose elder brother Nehemiah Odhiambo also took two wickets. On resumption, Lions leading batsmen were not as clinical and comfortable since Swami bowlers took them apart in rapid fashion. This strategy hugely neutralised the usually deadly Stray Lions, thus ending up 51 shy of the target while their wickets kept falling. Only Rajiv Sutaria (42 off 37 balls) had a reasonable score for Lions before being bowled out by the experienced Lameck Onyango (3-24). Jadavji Bhimji (3-13) and James Ngoche (2-28) were on point with their deliveries. Meanwhile, defending champions Kanbis ripped apart Obuya Academy by eight wickets on Saturday. The losing side had won the toss and selected to bat. Obuya thus posted 115/7 in their allotted overs with youngster Tom Ochieng (39 off 46 balls) not out emerging top scorer. Openers Collins Omondi (27 off 24 balls) and Steve Omogo (9 off 17 balls) were perfectly bowled out by Rajesh Bhudia (61 off 36 balls) before Kanbis turned the screw afterwards led by Bhudia on 11 boundaries to reach 116/2 in 12.4 overs.
