Nut traders from the central region want the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) to tighten its grip on premature harvesting of macadamia. Johnstone Kihara, the chairman of Nuts Traders Association of Kenya, said six processors are buying macadamia from farmers even before the stipulated date. In November last year AFA imposed a ban on harvesting of macadamia for three months and the harvesting is supposed to start on February 15. Quick cash Kihara, however, said there are unscrupulous processors who are sending their agents to secretly buy nuts while duping farmers into making quick cash. He said the processor are rushing to fill their stores before the ban is lifted as they are speculations the prices might go high. Kihara said there are 30 licensed processors in the country and once the ban is lifted, competition is bound to be high pushing up prices. “These processors are buying macadamia at a throw-away price for as low as Sh50 and Sh70 per kilo” he said. This trend, he said, has  given rise to theft of macadamia from farms with numerous cases being reported in parts of Murang’a and Kirinyaga. The chairman now wants proper structures put in place to protect farmers from unscrupulous traders who are denying them their rightful benefits. Market liberation Kihara insisted that section 43 of the AFA Act be scrapped as it will create room for liberation of the market. He said an independent department should be formed to handle the sector and have macadamia removed under the management of AFA.
