Alvin Mwangi @peopledailyke Wiper Democratic Movement party has called on ODM to consider dropping its candidate for the Embakasi South by-elections scheduled to take place on April 5. Speaking yesterday when the party officially gave the Julius Mawathe a direct ticket, the party leader, Kalonzo Musyoka called on ODM to support the immediate former MP  in the same spirit of handshake. Kalonzo said other affiliates of NASA coalition have already declared their support for Wiper pointing out that  ODM has no other choice but to support Wiper get one seat in Nairobi County. “I would hate to see a situation where me and my brother Raila are contesting yet we have a Handshake,” Kalonzo posed. “However, I will continue to engage Raila if it will be possible for the party to leave for us the seat”, Kalonzo added. At the same time Kalonzo called on voters to turn out in large numbers and foresaw a titanic battle in case ODM fails to withdraw their candidate. Kalonzo claimed that this time, Mawathe would garner 55,000 votes, an increase from the previous election where he got 33,000. “We have taken a unanimous decision to back Mawathe and without doubt we expect this to be an overwhelming win. That is our expectation,” Kalonzo maintained.
