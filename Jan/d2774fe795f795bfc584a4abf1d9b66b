Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Police in Nakuru have arrested an MCA who they  accuse of inciting victims of last year’s Solai dam tragedy after a section of Patel Farm was set on fire by angry protesters yesterday. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Mwongo Chimwanga said Bahati MCA  Peter Mbae will be charged with malicious damage to property and causing disturbance. Chimwanga said four other suspects were also arrested by anti-riot police who were called  to quell the demonstration. Mbae had called a meeting to formally launch a suit against Mansukh Patel—the owner of the Patel Farm—after one of the dams broke its walls killing 49 people downstream last year. But Chimwanga accused Mbae of using the Solai issue for selfish political gain saying his conduct would  not be tolerated. “ He will be answerable for his action because this is a country governed by the Constitution,” said the commissioner.
