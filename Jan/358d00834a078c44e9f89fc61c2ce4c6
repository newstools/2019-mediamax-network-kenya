Spizzo, musician Best thing about being a musician? The fact that I am able to inspire people through music. One thing that people don’t know about you? I am from a small town in Diani where many people do not have access to media, studio, radio or TV. Memorable country you have ever been to? Maldives. It’s a lovely place with beautiful sceneries. Maybe that’s where I would take my girl for honeymoon. Highest amount of money you have ever been paid? A few years back I was paid Sh400,000 when I was on tour in Dubai. What’s your favourite restaurant in town? Kilimanjaro. Their Swahili food is to die for. Jamia mall also has a few eat out joints that serves Swahili food.  By that you can easily tell that I am a fan of African dishes, especially Swahili meals. Best place you have ever visited in Nairobi? The Nairobi National Park. There is so much that they offer at a reasonable price. Worst advice you have ever received? I was once told that niache mziki juu haina doo (I should stop doing music because it doesn’t pay.) Best childhood memories? We all gave our parents a hard time, especially in the kitchen. We would wait for her to prepare a meal and steal a few pieces of meat before they boil. Those were some good old days. Perfect way to relax? Staying at home and watching a movie. Hardest decision you have ever made? Leaving my home in Diani and coming to Nairobi. Mind you, I did not have any relatives around, so I had to hustle. Best advice you ever got? My mother once told me that I should always believe in myself. I have always stuck to that till now.
