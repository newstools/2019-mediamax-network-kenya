The High Court has granted three members of the Ngirita family facing charges related to the loss of Sh226 million at the National Youth Service (NYS) seven days to file an application seeking to overturn preservation orders for their property. Justice Hedwig Ong’undi directed Phylis Ngirita, Lucy Ngirita and Jeremiah Ngirita to file a fresh application opposing Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) from preserving three motor vehicles and five parcel of land which are alleged to be proceeds of crime. “The respondents are hereby directed to file and serve an application for reinstatement of the application dated December 7, 2018 and dismissed on December 18, 2018. This should be done within seven days,”he ruled. Denied charges Ong’undi allowed the Ngiritas more time to file their application seeking to set aside the orders for preservation of their property issued by Justice John Onyiego on December 4, 2018 after they failed to turn up in court for the hearing of the application. All the suspects have denied charges of fraudulently receiving payments from NYS for goods not supplied. The prosecution claims the Ngiritas received huge amounts of the Sh226 million through their companies and personal accounts. They now want the court to overturn its own decision granting ARA orders prohibiting them from transferring, selling or developing the parcel of lands in question.
