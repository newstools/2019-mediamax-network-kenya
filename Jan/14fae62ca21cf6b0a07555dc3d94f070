Harambee Stars will face Burundi’s Swallows in the first round of the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) qualifiers, the fixture beginning at home in May. Victory will hand Stars a chance to face the winner between Tanzania and Sudan as the national side chase their maiden appearance at the continental show-piece reserved for home-based players which has eluded them since its inception 10 years ago. On paper, Kenya looks the better team if the current FIFA rankings are anything to go by as they are ranked 105 while Burundi are 139. However, current form suggest otherwise as Burundi are on the verge of qualifying for June’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Kenya were close to making their maiden appearance in the event after being granted the hosting rights for the 2018 edition but the tournament was taken  away from the them in September 2017 with Confederation of African Football (CAF) citing delays in preparations. With work on earmarked facilities dragging on for years, CAF pulled the plug on Kenya and gave Morocco the hosting rights of the fifth edition which they went on to win after thrashing Nigeria 4-0 in a rain-soaked final. At the time Kenya lost the hosting rights, only Kasarani Stadium had been given a clean bill of health since works at Nyayo, Kinoru and Kipchoge stadiums had stalled. In the last qualifiers that Stars featured in 2015, for the 2016 edition, the team was eliminated by Walya Antelopes of Ethiopia after playing for a draw in Nairobi before losing 2-0 away.
