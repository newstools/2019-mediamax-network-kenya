PD Correspondent A private healthcare company has announced an intense programme to reach out to members of the security agencies with free counselling services and diagnosis for basic conditions to help them cope with stressful situations in their job. Speaking on K24 TV’s Daily Brief talk show, Director of Operations at Bliss Healthcare, Dr Martin Wafula said  free medical camps programme will prioritise counselling, diagnosis and awareness of stress-related conditions. Wafula said they have been concentrating its services to security agencies on diagnosis and awareness of common conditions like diabetes and hypertension but would now shed focus on stress management given the high pressure conditions which officers are subjected to. He was speaking in reference to the recent security operation that engaged over 200 members of security agencies in countering terrorists who attacked the DusitD2 Hotel complex two weeks ago. “They work under very stressful conditions which render them susceptible to conditions that are stress-related, they need utmost care throughout their careers,” said Wafula. Last year, Bliss Healthcare offered 50 free medical camps to officers in police stations, Administration Police camps and prisons.
