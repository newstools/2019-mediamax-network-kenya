Albert Njogu came from behind to win 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 in an intriguing second round match against Italian Gianni Biagianti in the ITF Juniors contest at Nairobi Club yesterday. Njogu, who was eliminated from the ITF World Tennis Tour event in the first leg quarters, had to be mentally alert to claim victory. The fourth seeded Kenyan was patient and calculative in the two-hour match as he went for sure shots especially from the baseline to catch his challenger off guard. The opening set saw Njogu start off casually as he allowed his opponent space and time to manoeuvre. His service was generally poor coupled with erratic returns which gave the Italian advantage on points. He fought to 2-5 following a series of errors from his opponent but was not as strong on finish. In the follow-up set, it was another titanic episode as both players countered each other. It was blitzing shots as Njogu ran wild with solid backhands while Biagianti had a mixture of forehands and slices to spice up his game. The Italian led 3-0 before Njogu fought back and overtook him from 5-4 to 5-5, then  7-5 with Biagianti getting frustrated on line calls. The same was witnessed in the decider set where an agitated Biagianti, who felt countlessly aggrieved on point calls, lost rhythm as his challenger stepped up. Njogu closed out the set after another long exchange but stood out for his discipline. “I knew how to handle the pressure and stuck to my game plan. My aim is to improve on last week’s performance so this is a good start,” he said. Meanwhile, Spain-based Kenyan Jayson Mbogori left it late for a fight he eventually lost 6-0, 6-3 to top seed Abdoul Shakur Kabura from Burundi. Kabura was faultless in the opening set as he controlled the match well but had to be focused in the second set when the British-born Mbogori came alive.
