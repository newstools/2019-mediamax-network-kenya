The supreme court has issued a  landmark ruling ,that expressly gives schools the authority to decide the dress code of the students ,bringing to an end the push and pull over  religious attire in schools . The 5 bench judge  led by chief justice David Maraga overturned an earlier decision by the court  of appeal allowing muslim students to wear Hijabs , in a move that will now see  muslim girls go to school without the religious headgear. The ruling has however sparked -off  from muslim leaders and islamic groups terming it discriminatory.
