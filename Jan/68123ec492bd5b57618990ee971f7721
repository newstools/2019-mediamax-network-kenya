Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi has won the Democratic Republic of Congo’s tightly contested presidential vote, the electoral commission says. Provisional results put him ahead of another opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, and the ruling coalition’s Emmanuel Shadary. If confirmed, Mr Tshisekedi will be the first opposition challenger to win since the DR Congo gained independence. Current President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after 18 years in office. He had promised DR Congo’s first orderly transfer of power since the country’s independence from Belgium in 1960. The election outcome was initially expected to be announced on Sunday. The interim result can still be challenged. -BBC
