Sophie Njoka and Teresa Ombiti @PeopleDailyKe Frequent breakdown of surveillance cameras in major cities is derailing the fight against crime and terrorism, Government Spokesman Erick Kiraithe said yesterday. He regretted that while the government had invested a lot of money in the cameras, little is being done to service the gadgets. “The county governments, which are charged with ensuring the cameras are serviced have neglected them,” said Kiraithe. He cited a recent incident where police were unable to review CCTV footage of an explosion on Tom Mboya Street, Nairobi, because the cameras were not working. Police are yet to identify the owner of the improvised explosive device that went off on Saturday evening injuring two people. Addressing the media in Mombasa yesterday, Kiraithe said the government was committed to the fight against terrorism.
