Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Low food prices, reduced electricity tariffs, declining fuel prices, stable shilling against foreign currencies and low inflation contributed to Central Bank Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) retaining the benchmark lending rate at nine per cent. The move will see borrowers get loans at an interest of 13 per cent in line with the interest rate capping rule that allows banks to charge only four percentage points above the Central Bank Rate (CBR). This was the third time since July 30 last year when the committee cut the lending rate from 9.5 per cent to nine per cent. In a statement, CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge attributed the retention of the interest rates to the key indicators such as inflation, foreign exchange,and the fact that the current account deficit was stable. “Inflation expectations remained well anchored within the target range and the economy was operating close to its potential,” Njoroge said. According to the committee, there was stable macroeconomic indicators, increased optimism on the economic growth prospects, lower international oil prices despite increased uncertainties and weaker global growth outlook. “Overall inflation is expected to decline in the near term, largely due to lower international oil prices, expectations of lower electricity prices following increased power generation from cheaper sources and expected stability in food prices. He said the foreign exchange market has remained stable supported by balanced flows and a narrowing in the current account deficit to 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to November compared to 6.5 per cent in November 2017. “This narrowing reflects strong growth in diaspora remittances and tourism receipts, higher tea and horticultural exports, slower growth in imports due to lower food and Standard Gauge Railway–related equipment imports and the decline in international oil prices,” Njoroge said.
