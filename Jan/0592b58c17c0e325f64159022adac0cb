At least 12 men were arrested at the Dadaab Refugee Camp, Garissa county, in a crackdown on terrorist activities in the country. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said one of the suspects had two passports.The suspects were said to be in the camp illegally and police suspected they had ulterior motives. Boinnet said one of the suspects had two foreign passports. “One of them has two New Zealand passports in different names. We don’t know the motive for now but investigations are ongoing,” said the police chief. The suspects were arrested during a security operation at the refugee camp, the third largest in the world, which mainly hosts refugees from Somalia. Dadaab camp, which is a UNHCR base, hosts more than 250,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in four camps. Police say they suspect some terrorists could be using the camp to plan attacks. In the Westgate terror attack of September 2013, it was established two of the attackers had posed as refugees. The raid at the camp on Monday comes in the wake of ongoing crackdown on terror suspects linked to the DusitD2 Complex attack on January 15 where at least 21 people were killed and 28 injured.
