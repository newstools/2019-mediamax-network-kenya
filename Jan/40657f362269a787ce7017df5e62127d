At the same time, four people were yesterday killed by a mob after they allegedly attempted to rob a home in Mihang’o area in Utawala, Nairobi. The incident happened at around noon after the four attempted to raid the home of George Masaku who was away during the incident. According to Masaku, the four broke into his compound and on entering his house, his children raised the alarm. “The gang gained access into my home by cutting an iron sheet at the gate and the padlock,” he said. Neighbours responded to the alarm and stoned them to death.
