Mutwiri Muriithi @mutwirimuriithi Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s) are set to benefit from an asset finance partnership seeking to address the access to funding challenge. This emerged after Isuzu East Africa, Co-operative Bank of Kenya and CIC Insurance announced a partnership that will see customers take up to a Sh300,000 loan. The loan has a 60 day repayment holiday at a low market negotiation fee rate of one per cent and a repayment period of five years. Isuzu EA managing director Rita Kavashe said the programme would enable customers invest back into their businesses. “SME businesses have had a difficult 18 months due to prolonged electioneering and lack of access to credit. This has drastically affected their cash flow and ability to invest in their business,” she added. Co-operative Bank director for retail and business banking Arthur Muchangi encouraged SMEs to take the opportunity to boost their businesses. “Through this partnership, customers will get up to 95 per cent financing to purchase a vehicle of their choice. Furthermore, they will be given two months to use the vehicle before they begin repaying the loan. This will give customers space to generate cash to service the loan,” he said.
