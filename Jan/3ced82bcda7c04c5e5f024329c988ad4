A UK based money laundering expert has told an anti-corruption court that due diligence was not observed in signing Anglo Leasing contracts between the government of Kenya and British companies. At the same time, Jason Campbell Sharman said companies linked to the ongoing Anglo Leasing case, a security contracts scandal in which the government lost billions of shillings, are shell firms and do not exist in law. Sharman, who gave expert opinion to EACC on the police contracts awarded to companies namely sound Day Corporation, Apex Finance Corporation and Infotalent Ltd linked to the Anglo Leasing scandal, informed trial magistrate Felix Kombo that the three were shell companies and the Kamani brothers- — Deepak and Rashmi (pictured) — and their father Chamanlal Kamani, were the beneficial owners of the companies. Money laundering He said Sound Day Corporation which had been awarded a contract to supply police security equipment at 40 million Euros (Sh3.8 billion) was incorporated for money laundering and corruption in British virgin Islands. Sharman further informed the court that the contract for modernisation of police equipment was signed between the government of Kenya and Sound Day Corporation but Apex Finance Corporation was paid. Sharman said a resolution of board of directors of Sound Day Corporation showed the owners are Rashmi Chamanlal Kamani, Deepak Chamanlal Kamani and Chamanlal Vrajlal Kamani. “This unambiguously demonstrates that the Kamanis are the real actors in control of both companies and their bank accounts at Midland Bank,” he said. Sharman was testifying in a case in which Rasmi, Deepak and Chamanlal are charged together with former Internal Security PS Dave Mwangi, former Finance Minister David Mwiraria (deceased), former PS Joseph Magari and David Onyonka of conspiracy to defraud the government 40 million Euros (Sh3.8billion).
