Emotions ran high at Igena Itambe village in Nyamira as a victim of 14 Riverside Drive terror attack was laid to rest. Zachary Nyabwanga, a guard, was reportedly helping evacuate  occupants of the hotel complex before he was shot by the terrorists. He was eulogised as a jovial, humble and helpful person. “Nyabwanga volunteered to help evacuate hundreds trapped at the complex and it was during this time he was shot by one of the attackers,” said Micah Omondi, his supervisor and an employee of Senaca Security. His wife, Janet Nyanchama, described Nyabwanga as a loving and caring man. The mourners were moved to tears when she revealed that Nyanchama’s death was double tragedy to her family because three months ago, they had buried their only child who succumbed to an illness.
