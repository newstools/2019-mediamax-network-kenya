Kenya has appointed Trade and Development Bank (TDB) and Standard Bank Group Ltd to arrange syndicated loans of $1 billion (Sh100.3 billion). “We have that mandate alongside Standard Bank,” Admassu Tadesse, the president and chief executive of TDB said by phone from Nairobi. The bank plans to raise the financing by April, he said without giving further details of the loan. There will be three tranches – a $250 million (Sh25.1 billion) 10-year debt and two seven-year loans of $410 million (Sh41.1 billion) and $340 million (Sh34.1 billion), a person with knowledge of the transaction said separately. The proceeds will be used to refinance loans, and fund some projects in the national budget, the person said, asking not to be identified because they are not authorised to comment on the matter. The transaction features an accordion option to raise an additional $250 million (Sh25.1 billion) that will be used to help finance projects under the 2018/19 budget, the person said. Treasury planned to raise about Sh280 billion of external debt to help plug the 2018/19 budget shortfall. That is even as more than $2 billion (Sh200.6 billion) of debt is maturing this year, and $1.28 billion (Sh128.4 billion) in 2020, according to government documents. The government is talking to banks separately to arrange a $2.5 billion (Sh250.8 billion) Eurobond-offering, probably during the first quarter, Reuters reported on Wednesday. In response to questions from Reuters, the finance ministry did not confirm the $2.5 billion (Sh250.8 billion) figure but said it has sought proposals from banks and firms to provide lead manager services for the issuance of the new Eurobond. In the government’s budget for the fiscal year that began in July Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich (pictured) set a net external financing target of Sh287 billion to partly cover the deficit.                                            –Bloomberg Additional reporting by Reuters
