London, Wednesday British Prime Minister Theresa May was on a collision course with the European Union on Wednesday after MPs demanded she renegotiates a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the bloc said they would not reopen. Less than two months before the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU on March 29, investors and allies are trying to gauge where the crisis will end up, with options including a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit, or no Brexit at all. Margin of defeat Two weeks after voting down May’s Brexit deal by the biggest margin of defeat for a government in modern British history, parliament demanded she return to Brussels to replace the so-called Irish backstop, an insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. May said she would seek “legally binding changes” to the divorce deal which she clinched in November with the EU after two years of tortuous negotiations. France, the EU’s second most powerful member, said there could be no renegotiation and demanded a “credible” British proposal. Germany has so far not given a public comment. European Council President Donald Tusk said the divorce deal was not up for renegotiation. While the EU has repeatedly refused to reopen the divorce deal, EU sources said additional clarifications, statements or assurances on the backstop might be possible. – Reuters
