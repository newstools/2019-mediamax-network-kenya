Sixteen others who pleaded not guilty were ordered to be released on Sh100,000 bond each with similar surety with an alternative cash bail of Sh100,000 each. Their case will be mentioned on January 29. The youth were among hundreds who reported at the college after a recruitment exercise conducted at 290 centres across the country in December last year. The youths told the court that they received the letters from persons purporting to be military officers after giving them money with a promise of getting a slot in the armed forces. KDF spokesman Paul Njuguna disowned the letters presented by a section of the youths arguing that they were not issued at the recruitment centres. During interrogations, different accounts from the youths indicated that they had parted with amounts ranging between Sh40,000 and Sh450,000 to be handed the letters. They claimed they parted with the money after they were convinced the letters were genuine as some of the fraudsters wore military uniform.
