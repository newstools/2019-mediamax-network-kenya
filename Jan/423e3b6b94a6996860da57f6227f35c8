Why did you opt for this bike? When I was shopping around for a bike, spec for spec it was the best one in terms of safety, comfort, power, and lightness. This is my third bike as it’s not advisable to get right onto a 1,000cc bike when you start riding. I, therefore, began on an Apache 150cc then moved up to a Kawasaki ninja 300cc. I rode that for a while until I was confident I could handle the power of the big bikes. What does this bike do for you? It’s an adrenaline shot. It has a top speed over 300kph so when you get on it, every single time you are going to get a rush. It’s hard to describe, but the sensation on being on a fast bike is like no other. The fastest I have been on this bike is 280km/h and that is a speed most people can never reach even in a car so you can imagine the sensations on a bike. Any memorable experiences on the bike? Every time I get on it is memorable, it never fails to please me. Specifically there is a time we rode from Nairobi to the Nanyuki Air base in just over an hour, which is fast. And I have also done a couple more road trips. Any downsides with the bike or riding in general? With the bike no. It’s a bike I’m comfortable with. It’s reliable and gets me going every time. One thing about riding any bike is that you have to be very careful and observant on the road, that’s standard. Just try and ride safe. I have heard that your son also rides, no worries from the mum and wife? No, not really. The fear was there at first, but the more we ride carefully and she realises that we come home every time, then the fear dissipates and the whole family comes to watch us race. Any parting words? I would advise someone looking to ride to first start on a small, low powered bike, get comfortable with the dynamics of riding and then build up from there until you get to the big bikes. Above all else, ride carefully.
