The Supreme Court is this morning scheduled to determine an election petition challenging Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama’s win in 2017 polls. According to a notice issued by the office of the deputy registrar of the apex court, the judgment will be delivered at 9am. Walter Osebe Nyambati, who contested the gubernatorial seat on a Jubilee ticket, had moved to Supreme Court after the High Court in Nyamira  and the Court of Appeal sitting in Kisumu upheld  Nyagarama’s election. Speaking to the press before heading to Nairobi for the verdict, Nyagarama said  he was confident the court would rule in his favour because he had won fairly contrary to his  rival’s claims. He said the case had adversely  distracted his agenda for development, adding that he wants it concluded so that he concentrate  fully on service delivery.
