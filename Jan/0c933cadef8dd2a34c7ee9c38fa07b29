One person died and  seven others injured following  clashes at Melelo and Olokruto wards of Narok county. Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya said the body of the middle-aged man from Melelo ward was found lying in the Maasai Mau forest over the weekend where he was grazing his livestock. He said security officers recovered his seven cows on Monday. However, after the recovery, 27 others were reported stolen from the neigbouring Sogoo ward in Narok South, triggering tension in the area. “A  team of Sogoo residents went in search of the cows in Olokruto area, but were attacked with bows, arrows, machetes and pangas and in the process seven people were injured,” said Natembeya. He said the seven injured were taken to Narok County Referral Hospital where three were treated and discharged. “We have realised there is a gap that needs to be filled, following stolen livestock is not the work of wananchi,” he said.  -KNA
