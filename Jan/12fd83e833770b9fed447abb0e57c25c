Leaders from North Eastern region have faulted Kenya National Examinations Council over the cancellation of KCSE exam results of some schools in the region. Led by Eldas MP Adan Keynan, the accused the council of punishing students “unnecessarily”. Speaking in Nairobi, the MP said supervisors, invigilators and school heads from the affected schools should be held accountable, not learners. “Before cancelling, let the government agencies conduct proper investigations,” said Keynan, adding that leaders from the region will pursue the matter. Students from at least 17 northeastern schools were among 3,427 those whose KSCE exam results were cancelled.
