With schools set to re-open for the first term on Wednesday, teachers from Rongo in Migori county insist they will down their tools to compel the government and the teachers service commission to address issues affecting teachers in general. Led by Rongo KNUT branch executive secretary, Thomas Ochiel Awino, the teachers accuse their employer of turning a blind eye to the many challenges they face in the line of duty.
