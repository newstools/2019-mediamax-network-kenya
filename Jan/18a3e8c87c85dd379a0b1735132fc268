Mercy Salisi and Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe The government has indefinitely suspended the controversial car-free days citing logistical factors. Through a press statement, the  Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development Cabinet secretary James Macharia said the move had been arrived at because some crucial preparations were yet to be completed. He cited the capture of the biometric data  of the traders using BVR which he said is an essential security aspect and has not yet been completed. Proposal rejected The postponement came hours after the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the  Central Organisation of Traders Union (Cotu) had  rejected the  proposal  arguing that the move would lead to job losses among workers. In a letter to the Attorney General AG, the LSK  faulted the government for not conducting a public participation forum for citizens to  express their views before issuing the directive. “While this is an idealistic, laudable attempt at beginning to solve the problem, it is impractical and unlawful in its execution in the absence of public participation,”  LSK President Allen Waiyak said. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said if implemented, the plan could see workers lose their jobs for  reporting to work late over transport crisis.
