Business at the Eastleigh, Nairobi hub came to a standstill on Friday, with business people closing down shops for hours to show solidarity with the victims of the Dusit D2 terror attack. The Kamukunji legislator led a host of business people in closing down their businesses for 2 hours to show solidarity with the victims and condemn the act.
