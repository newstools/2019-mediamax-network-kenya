Bernard Gitau @benagitau The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has recommended the immediate suspension of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) compensation to pave the  way for investigations on possible fraud in the process. Haji and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) wrote  to various State agencies to suspend any payment. “We have agreed to start investigations immediately and we are writing to various authorities asking them to cease all payments until we are through,” said Haji. The DPP spoke at Kilimani area during the handing over of Sh2 billion land to University of Nairobi (UoN), recovered from Aberdares Engineering Contractors Limited. The firm owned by Alfred Mwangi, 80, agreed to an out-of-court settlement and handed over the land  that had been grabbed from the university. EACC chair Eliud Wabukala, chief executive Twalib Mbarak, UoN Chancellor Vijoo Rattansi, and Vice Chancellor Peter Mbithi had accompanied Haji. EACC and ODPP vowed to recover assets and monies obtained through corruption. “All public land and assets that have been grabbed will be reclaimed and utilised for the intended purpose,” said Haji. He said the agencies are on the verge of reclaiming Racecourse Primary School land worth Sh154 million and banks are refunding NYS fraud funds. The  move to stop the SGR payouts came after confusion in compensation of landowners affected by Phase 2A of the project in Rongai, Ngong-Mai Mahiu, and Suswa station. National Land Commission (NLC) has been under pressure from Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and landowners to release the money. On Monday, KRC sued NLC for failing to compensate 1,090 people affected by the project. KRC claims NLC has received Sh7.7 billion from Treasury for the compensation.  Agency’s lawyer Peter Munge argued that non-payment has led to stalling of the SGR project, which may affect the completion deadline scheduled May 31.
