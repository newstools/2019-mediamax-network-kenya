Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The National Assembly has raised concerns over stalled 130 Technical Training Technical Institutions (TTI) that had been under construction at a cost of Sh51.4 billion. The government launched the new institutions in 2015 as a measure to equip the youth with necessary skills to tame rising unemployment. Yesterday MPs also demanded to know why most of the TTIs were on pieces of land without valid titles. According to them, the government should kick-start the process of acquiring titles for the lands to protect government assets. At a meeting between Public Accounts committee and Vocational Technical Training PS Kevit Desai (pictured), committee chair Opiyo Wandayi demanded that the ministry tables a policy document showing how the government developed such ambitious projects yet no progress has been done. “Looking at the documents we have, some of the TTIs were commissioned in 2014 and up to now nothing has been done,” he said. The affected projects are Kakrao, Nyakach, Riamo, Taita Taveta, Kaloleni and Lamu East TTIs. In response, Desai said some of the projects delayed because contractors had been changed while others had their scope of work altered.
