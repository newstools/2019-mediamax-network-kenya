Beijing, Tuesday China on Tuesday accused the United States of “political motivations” behind sweeping charges against Chinese telecom giant Huawei in a case that has ratcheted up tensions between the two superpowers. The Justice Department Monday unveiled 13 charges against Huawei Technologies, its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou—the daughter of the company’s founder—and two affiliates related to violating US sanctions on Iran. The firm was also accused of technology theft on the same day China’s top trade negotiator arrived in Washington for high-stakes talks with US officials, possibly complicating the discussions ahead of a March deadline to avert a deepening of their trade war. China’s foreign ministry said there were “strong political motivations and political manipulations” behind the charges. “For some time, the US has used state power to smear and suppress specific Chinese companies in an attempt to stifle their legitimate business activities,” ministry spokesman Geng Shaung said at a regular briefing. -AFP
