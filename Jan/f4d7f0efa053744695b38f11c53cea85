The IED that went off at Odeon Cinema, on Latema-Tom Mboya Street junction at about 7pm, reportedly injured a trolley puller identified as Jackson Okinyi and a newspaper vendor (pictured). Detectives are working to establish the motive of detonating the IED at the crowded street amid fears the culprits were testing the waters in preparation for more attacks.
