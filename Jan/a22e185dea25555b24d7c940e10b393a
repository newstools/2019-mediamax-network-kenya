A section of MPs from the Northern Kenya region have condemned mass cancellation of last year’s KCSE exam results and called for remarking of exam papers for the affected schools. According to the MPs, there were substantial errors and mistakes that would overturn the nullification of the exam in at least 18 centres in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties. They claim that despite a pre-monitoring exercise to sensitise schools against cheating, the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) has proved ineffective in curbing cheating. The MPs  want a scientific forensic audit by an independent firm to verify the legitimacy of the cancellation. Dadaab MP Dahiye Duale and his Wajir East counterpart Rashid Kassim said nine lawmakers regretted that despite the government spending huge amounts of money to supervise the exams, it is unfortunate that Knec cancelled the results because of what they termed as mass irregularities. “We believe this is proof that Knec has failed in its mandate to provide tamper-proof exams for candidates as per the law,” said Duale at Parliament Buildings yesterday. The MPs have threatened to take legal action and mobilise their colleagues for support if Knec fails to rescind its decision to cancel the results and immediately release them to the affected students.
