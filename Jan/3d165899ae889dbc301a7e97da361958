With investigations into the Dusit D2 attack in Riverside in top gear, we set out  to establish more about the kind of lifestyle  some the men who carried out the murderous attacked lived. We  managed to trace the owner of a butchery in Mucatha, where one of the terrorists frequently bought meat,  including  3 days before the fateful attack, which was also the last day he was seen alive in the neighborhood.
