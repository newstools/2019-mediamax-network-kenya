Munira Mandano National Land Commission (NLC) chairman Muhammad Swazuri has issued a 90-day ultimatum for the private developers to vacate from nine islands at Ramisi area in Msambweni constituency, Kwale county. The islands, whose titles have been revoked are Makasi, Vamia, Milimani, Vyongwani, Kinazini, Mwamboje, Samaa, Ngoji and King’amboni. This comes after the commission learned that the private developers were illegally owning the community land. “I urge the private developers to return back all the title deeds of the nine islands to the commission by February 20,” said Swazuri. He noted that the private developers have been ignoring orders to vacate the islands and said if they defy orders they will be forcefully removed. Speaking at Bodo area after a meeting with residents yesterday,  Swazuri appealed to security agents to ensure tycoons vacate the area once the 90-day ultimatum is over. “I appeal to the security officers to make sure that these people vacate from this area so that residents can get back their parcels of land,” he said. Swazuri said the court had earlier on revoked 25 title deeds  including those of the islands yet the private developers ignored the court orders. “In 2014, the High Court in Mombasa revoked 25 title deeds that included the nine islands,” he said. “There was conflict between the residents and the private developers and when they moved to court, it was resolved that the private developers were on that land illegally and ordered to vacate the area with immediate effect but they are yet to do so,” said Swazuri.
