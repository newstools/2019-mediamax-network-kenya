That cult of ‘healthy eating’ clique with various other sub-cults that are always in superiority contests over which works better/faster. You’re seriously considering jumping on the bandwagon, if you haven’t already. Tread carefully though, they may not be the best idea if you’re looking for long term goals, according to health practitioners. So, how do you spot one?

Go have yourself a healthful helping.
