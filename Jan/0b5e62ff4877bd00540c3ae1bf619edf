Milliam Murigi and Grace Angela @PeopleDailyKe The Advocacy Agenda of People Living with Non-communicable Diseases  in Kenya has urged the government to incorporate non-infectious ailments in the Universal Health Coverage programme. Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, Renal Patients Society of Kenya president John Gikonyo, also Non-communicable Diseases  (NCD) Alliance Kenya coordinator, said thousands of people lose their lives to NCD every year because of lack of awareness, data and affordable treatment. He said there is no data showing how many Kenyans are living with NCDs because some health workers cannot accurately diagnose the diseases, making it hard for patients to know their conditions and act in time. “We demand that county governments include NCD in their health budget. We also need active registries to capture how many we are,” read part of the lobby’s agenda. Other demands include legislation that recognises and supports people living with NCDs.
