Natasha Waithera  and Teresa Ombiti Legislators from across East Africa attending a weeklong training for improved budget oversight and accountability have identified corruption as a major hindrance to development. Speaking at a Mombasa hotel, parliamentarians from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan said most countries will not attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) because of corruption. They said most of the countries were losing huge amount of their budgets to graft thus dwarfing development. Nairobi County Women Representative Passaris (pictured) said lack of proper planning and strategies to localise the same to the vision of the country could also hamper attainment of the goals. “Leaders are full of themselves and poverty cannot be eradicated in the presence of corruption, the Parliament should present the budget in time for actual and effective reports,” Passaris said. The training programme is organised by the African Organisation of Public Accounts Committees (AFROPAC) and East Africa Association of Public Accounts Committees (EAAPAC).
