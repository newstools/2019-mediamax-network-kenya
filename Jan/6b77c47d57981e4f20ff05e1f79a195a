Ford Kenya party delegates have endorsed Bungoma Senator, Moses Wetangula, as their preferred presidential candidate for the 2022 general election saying that he fits the bill.
The party has also warned rebel members who have been working closely with the Jubilee party, saying the party will soon crack the whip. Wetangula dismissed claims that he was sending emissaries to the Deputy President William Ruto.
