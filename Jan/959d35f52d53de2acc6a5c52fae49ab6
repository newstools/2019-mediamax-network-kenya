Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga Kenya’s luxury five-star hotel Hemingways-Nairobi has been ranked as one of the best hotels in Africa in three categories, according to the latest ranking by global travel website Trip Advisor. Hemingways-Nairobi was the only Kenyan-based hotel featured in the the 2019 Travelers’ Choice Award. The hotel emerged 13 in the rank of Top 25 Hotels in Africa; position 14 in Top 25 Luxury Hotels in Africa and number 23 in the category of Top 25 Hotels for Service in Africa. The rating is based on reviews and opinions from ordinary travellers who rate facilities they visited in the past year. The hotel also took the number one spot in three categories – Top 10 Hotels – Kenya, Top 10 Luxury Hotels – Kenya and Top 10 Hotels for Service – Kenya. Hemingways collection operations director Ross Evans said the awards are the greatest vote of confidence for Nairobi despite the recent scare caused by the Dusit attacks. He said the listing is also an endorsement of the quality service and luxury stay the destination offers to tourists. “Being among the top hotels in Africa, especially in the luxury and service categories, we reaffirm to the world that Nairobi is a world-class destination with hotels that match the quality that a luxury traveler expects,” he said. Since opening, just over five years ago, the Karen-based hotel has featured highly in the coveted hotel rankings, also uplifting its sister establishments – Hemingways Watamu and Ol Seki Hemingways Mara.
