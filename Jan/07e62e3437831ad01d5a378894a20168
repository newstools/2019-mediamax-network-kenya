More than 1.2 million Kenyans earning monthly stipends through the Cash Transfer programmes will now be registered with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to access quality medicalcare. Beneficiaries include orphans and vulnerable children, older persons and persons with severe disabilities. Social Protection PS Nelson Marwa said the department is in consultations with Health ministry to enroll beneficiaries of the Inua Jamii programme with the NHIF to cushion them from the challenges of getting treatment due to poverty. To achieve this, Marwa said his department will come up with a social assistance policy fund anchored on financial management framework to attract donor funding to broaden the capital base to enable an increase in membership and raise the monthly stipends given to beneficiaries. He said most of the beneficiaries enlisted with the three cash transfer programmes live below poverty line which makes it impossible for them to get treatment in both private and public hospitals hence the need to register with the NHIF. “We will broaden the sources of funding for the Inua Jamii Programme by bringing in donors such as Unicef, the World Bank, UNDP and a host of other donors to cut down on relying on the exchequer only,” Marwa said during a media interview at his Nairobi office.
