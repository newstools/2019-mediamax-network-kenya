Noah Chepleon and  Robert Ochoro Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama says Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i is best suited to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. Speaking to People Daily yesterday, the Jubilee Party legislator said Matiang’i has the potential to  make a good president if given the chance, adding that his track record in public service in the last six years speaks for itself. “By voting for Matiang’i, Kenyans will be killing two birds with one stone. They will end the dominance by the three big tribes witnessed in past elections and also get a strong personality who will bring change,” he said. Were it not for the tribal nature of our politics, Matiang’i would be a frontrunner because he has done remarkable work for this country, Arama said. “We have seen change in every ministry he has worked in and Kenyans are glad to have him. In fact some have been asking the president to make him the chief minister,” Arama said. Arama, who was first elected on an ODM ticket in 2013 before switching his allegiance to Jubilee, urged Kenyans to make a difference in 2022 by electing leaders based on performance and not ethnicity. He said he would vie for the Nakuru gubernatorial seat in 2022 and urged residents to vote for him based on his  track record.
