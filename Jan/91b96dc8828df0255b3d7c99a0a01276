Nancy Gitonga and Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe An employee of National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has been detained for 30 days in connection with DusitD2 terror attack. Investigators applied to detain Augustine Mulwa Musembi, who was arrested over possible aiding and abetting the 14 Riverside Drive attack. Anti-terror police said Musembi is believed to have been involved in a cartel to make vehicle licence plates. Detectives told the court investigations on the matter are complex and they require additional time for the same. A vehicle bearing similar registration number to that used by the terrorists was recovered in Kitengela, Kajiado, and the investigators said one of the number plates was either fake or issued fraudulently. At the same time, police arrested an NTSA director and some junior employees over the double registration of vehicles, and carted away some computers.
