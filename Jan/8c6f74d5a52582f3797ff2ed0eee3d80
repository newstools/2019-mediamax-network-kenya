Bernice Mbugua @bernicemuhindi Kenya Hospital Association, which owns Nairobi Hospital, and Dr Praxedes Okutoyi were yesterday ordered to pay Sh43 million to a patient who underwent surgery and suffered brain damage. Justice George Odunga directed the hospital to pay Sh43,469,000 to Jacob Oluochi Ondeko, who was student at St Mary’s School in 2005 and Sh1,071,080 each to his parents John Ondeko and Margaret Ondeko. In judgement read on his behalf by Justice Lucy Njuguna, Justice Odunga said the brain damage was caused by failure of the duty care owed to Ondeko by the hospital and the doctor who was the anaesthetist. The parents who sued the hospital on behalf of their son, had claimed that Ondeko sustained a nasal fracture in February 8, 2005 while playing basketball at school where he was a Form Four student. The 17-year-old then, was taken to Nairobi Hospital on February 11 by his father for a surgery to rectify the fracture. However, he sustained a brain damage which the parents claimed arose from the hospital’s careless, negligent and reckless execution of that surgery. “As a result of his health being near fatal condition with no pulse, he was subjected to cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and upon restoration of his heartbeat he was put in Intensive Care Unit,” the parents who are also doctors had claimed in court documents. Justice Odunga granted the now 31-year-old man Sh5 million for general damages, pain, suffering and loss of amenities noting that he was 17 years at the age of surgery. He further awarded him Sh3,960,000 to cater for his care giver after the court heard that he now requires a full-time minder. His parents had told the court that they pay his full-time helper Sh10,000 a month. The judge adopted 50 years as the life expectancy that he should be paid.
