More than 20 Kitui MCAs have threatened to impeach governor Charity Ngilu (below) over alleged inequitable distribution of resources. Led by county Leader of Majority Peter Kilonzo (Athi) and Chief Whip Stephen Kivunzi (Kyuso), the MCAs claimed Mwingi has been allocated less than Sh50 million for development, despite being the worst hit by water shortage and perennial crop failure. Speaking at Musila Gardens on Thursday after being hosted by Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi, the MCAs vowed to move an impeachment motion against Ngilu once the House resumes business on February 13. The MCAs urged the legislator to go for the county’s top seat in 2022 and dislodge Ngilu, who they claimed is a “stranger” in the Wiper party-dominated zone. Ngilu had recently warned MCAs she will not give in to their demands to change her manifesto and agenda for the county. She said she would rather have the county government dissolved and fresh elections held, than yield to MCAs’ demands for alleged luxury holiday trips, packaged as bonding retreats, or be pushed to implement projects that do not reflect residents’ wishes. -Charles Muasya
