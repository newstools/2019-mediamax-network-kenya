Gender Affairs PS Safina Kwekwe has called for concerted efforts to fight emerging trends in Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). She expressed concerns that the gains made in the fight against the vice are being eroded by new forms of FGM, in which the practice has morphed from just a rite of passage into more sinister forms such as cutting babies. “We are seeing girls being cut before they learn how to cry and older women being coerced to undergo the cut so that their boys can get circumcised. We are also witnessing cases of women being secretly cut when they are giving birth and others crossing the border to neighbouring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania to undergo the cut,” she said. Kwekwe was speaking during an Editors breakfast briefing on the second National FGM conference and commemoration of International Day of Zero tolerance for FGM, which is marked on February 6. The conference will take place from February 4 to 5  at the Maasai Mara University in Narok county under the theme: ‘Ending FGM is My Responsibility’.
