We are asking the county government to move this dumpsite from residential area,” said Abdalla Said, one of the house owners. The uncollected garbage has forced food joints and shops to close down with a medical facility management saying the stench has become unbearable for patients. Margaret Maiba, a receptionist at the facility, said the hospital has been forced to terminate in-patient programmes because the stench from the dumpsite was harmful to patients. “Patients have been finding it difficult to even sit inside this hospital complaining of stomachaches as a result of the stench,” said Maiba. In an interview with People Daily yesterday, the residents complained that the dumpsite has created a fertile ground for breeding of mosquitoes.

He said the county was only paying attention to tax collection but not bothered by the environmental hazard posed by the heaps of garbage.
